===================================
Event 1: [lines 12-14]

    ROMNEY: They&#39;ll have at least two plans.

 ** ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be &lt;&lt;as efficient
            as&gt;&gt; the private sector and offer premiums that are &lt;&lt;as
            low as&gt;&gt; the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 22-24]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that I&#39;ve put forward.

 ** ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but &lt;&lt;also&gt;&gt; it came from
            Bill Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you &lt;&lt;also&gt;&gt; had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 115-117]

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

 ** OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we &lt;&lt;also&gt;&gt; made sure that
            all the help that we provided those banks was paid back
            every single dime, with interest.

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 132-134]

    ROMNEY: You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren&#39;t
            qualified.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s &lt;&lt;exactly&gt;&gt; right.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 170-172]

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans?

 ** ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us &lt;&lt;less
            like&gt;&gt;ly to hire people.

    ROMNEY: I just don&#39;t know how the president could have come into
            office, facing twenty three million people out of work,
            rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at the
            kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two
            years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs
            for the American people. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 183-185]

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

 ** OBAMA:  And let me tell you &lt;&lt;exactly&gt;&gt; what Obamacare did.

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  And it &lt;&lt;also&gt;&gt; says that you&#39;re going to have to get
            rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.
