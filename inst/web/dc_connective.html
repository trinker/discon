===================================
Event 1: [lines 1-3]

    LEHRER: We&#39;ll talk about specifically about health care in a
            moment.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

    ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near
            retirees to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt;
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 3-5]

    ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near
            retirees to Medicare.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; the president supports taking dollar seven
            hundred sixteen billion out of that program.

    LEHRER: And what about the vouchers? 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 4-6]

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; what about the vouchers?

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 6-8]

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young,
            what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place
            for them is to allow them either to choose the current
            Medicare program &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; a private plan.

    ROMNEY: Their choice. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 8-10]

    ROMNEY: Their choice.

 ** ROMNEY: They get to choose &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; they&#39;ll have at least two
            plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.

    ROMNEY: So they don&#39;t have to pay additional money, no additional
            dollar six thousand. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 12-14]

    ROMNEY: They&#39;ll have at least two plans.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; by the way, if the government can be as efficient
            as the private sector &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; offer premiums that are as
            low as the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; they&#39;ll be able to get a
            private plan.

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; find
            a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 17-19]

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; people make their own choice.

    ROMNEY: The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 19-21]

    ROMNEY: The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?

 ** ROMNEY: We have to have the benefits high for those that are low
            income, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; for higher income people, we&#39;re going to
            have to lower some of the benefits.

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 22-24]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that I&#39;ve put forward.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt;, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan
            &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the
            bill with with Paul Ryan in the Senate, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; also it
            came from Bill Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 26-28]

    OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; private insurers have to make a profit.

    OBAMA:  Nothing wrong with that. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 29-31]

    OBAMA:  That&#39;s what they do.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:  And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 31-33]

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; when you move to a voucher system, you are
            putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance
            companies.

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 32-34]

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed
            &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck.

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 33-35]

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; this is the reason why AARP has said that your
            plan would weaken Medicare substantially.

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 34-36]

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach
            that we took.

    OBAMA:  One last point I want to make. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 36-38]

    OBAMA:  One last point I want to make.

 ** OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; Medicaid|

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 38-40]

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; overall.

    LEHRER: OK. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 40-42]

    LEHRER: OK.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; so|

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s that&#39;s a big topic. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; all I want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 50-52]

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare.

 ** ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the
            service at lower cost &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; without a profit.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 54-56]

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; my experience my experience the private sector
            typically is able to provide a better product at a lower
            cost.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 64-66]

    LEHRER: Is there too much?

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; in your case, Mister President, is there should
            there be more?

    LEHRER: Beginning with you. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 67-69]

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; then we&#39;re
            going to go to health care, OK?

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 72-74]

    ROMNEY: I needed them there.

 ** ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; making loans.

    ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have
            an economy work. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation
            that&#39;s been passed during the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve
            seen regulation become excessive, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s
            hurt the economy.

    ROMNEY: Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; it includes within it a number of provisions that
            I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful
            to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 85-87]

    ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that I
            think has some unintended consequences that are harmful
            to the economy.

 ** ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the
            federal government.

    ROMNEY: This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New York
            banks I&#39;ve ever seen. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 88-90]

    ROMNEY: This is an enormous boon for them.

 ** ROMNEY: There&#39;ve been one hundred twenty two community &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt;
            small banks have closed since Dodd Frank.

    ROMNEY: So there&#39;s one example. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; replace it.

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 96-98]

    ROMNEY: You have to have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all
            the sense in the world.

    ROMNEY: You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits
            for| 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 99-101]

    LEHRER: Well, here&#39;s a specific|

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; let&#39;s let&#39;s mention let me mention the other one.

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s talk| 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 102-104]

    LEHRER: No, let&#39;s not.

 ** LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; what the governor just
            said.

    OBAMA:  I think this is a great example. 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt;
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt;
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 111-113]

    OBAMA:  So what did we do?

 ** OBAMA:  We stepped in &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; had the toughest reforms on Wall
            Street since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys.

    OBAMA:  We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
            capital requirements. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt;, you know, I appreciate &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; it appears we&#39;ve
            got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 40: [lines 118-120]

    OBAMA:  And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got some
            agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some
            regulation.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; in the past, Governor Romney has said he just
            want to repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back.

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street? 
 
===================================
Event 41: [lines 119-121]

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; so the question is: Does anybody out there think
            that the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; regulation of Wall Street?

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate. 
 
===================================
Event 42: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; that&#39;s not what I believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 43: [lines 122-124]

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe.

 ** ROMNEY: Sorry, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts.

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. 
 
===================================
Event 44: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 45: [lines 128-130]

    ROMNEY: It wasn&#39;t thought through properly.

 ** ROMNEY: We need to get rid of that provision because it&#39;s killing
            regional &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; small banks.

    ROMNEY: They&#39;re getting hurt. 
 
===================================
Event 46: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; if you give a mortgage
            that&#39;s not qualified, there are big penalties, except
            they didn&#39;t ever go on &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 47: [lines 138-140]

    ROMNEY: So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.

 ** ROMNEY: Try &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; get a mortgage these days.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you
            have to have. 
 
===================================
Event 48: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; our business, because I want to
            bring back housing &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 49: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 50: [lines 146-148]

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; that
            means two minutes each.

    LEHRER: And you go first, Governor Romney. 
 
===================================
Event 51: [lines 147-149]

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; you go first, Governor Romney.

    LEHRER: You want it repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 52: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself &lt;&lt;or&gt;&gt; my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 53: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 54: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that
            are saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 55: [lines 157-159]

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

    ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, when when when you look at Obamacare,
            the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost
            dollar two thousand five hundred a year more than
            traditional insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 56: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt;, unfortunately, when when when you look at
            Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 57: [lines 160-162]

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; as a matter of fact, when the president ran for
            office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought
            down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two
            thousand five hundred a family.

    ROMNEY: Instead, it&#39;s gone up by that amount. 
 
===================================
Event 58: [lines 170-172]

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; three quarters of them said it makes us less
            likely to hire people.

    ROMNEY: I just don&#39;t know how the president could have come into
            office, facing twenty three million people out of work,
            rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at the
            kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two
            years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs
            for the American people. 
 
===================================
Event 59: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: I just don&#39;t know how the president could have come into
            office, facing twenty three million people out of work,
            rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at the
            kitchen table, &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; spend his energy &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; passion
            for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting
            for jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 60: [lines 173-175]

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; the best course for health care is to do what we
            did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that
            fits the needs of the state.

    ROMNEY: And then let&#39;s focus on getting the costs down for
            people, rather than raising it with the dollar two
            thousand five hundred additional premium. 
 
===================================
Event 61: [lines 174-176]

    ROMNEY: And the best course for health care is to do what we did
            in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits

            people, rather than raising it with the dollar two
            thousand five hundred additional premium.

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal? 
 
===================================
Event 62: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 63: [lines 177-179]

    OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around and having those same conversations
            that Governor Romney talks about.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; they couldn&#39;t get affordable
            coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
            employees.

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country. 
 
===================================
Event 64: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.

 ** OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt;
            it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 65: [lines 181-183]

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their
            premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; behold,
            they don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, because
            the insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country. 
 
===================================
Event 66: [lines 183-185]

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover. 
 
===================================
Event 67: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. 
 
===================================
Event 68: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get
            rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; profits than they are on
            actual care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market. 
 
===================================
Event 69: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me,
            was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work really
            well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good
            thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what
            is essentially the identical model &lt;&lt;and&gt;&gt; as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 70: [lines 196-198]

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;And&gt;&gt; as a consequence, we now have a system in which
            we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as
            opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the
            cold.

    LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.
