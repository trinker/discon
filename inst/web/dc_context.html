$context
===================================
Event 1: [lines 12-14]

    ROMNEY: They&#39;ll have at least two plans.

 ** ROMNEY: And by the way, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; the government can be as efficient
            as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low
            as the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find
            a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 23-25]

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

 ** ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; we can&#39;t get competition
            into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice
            of different plans at lower cost, better quality.

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; I &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; I can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:  And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 31-33]

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; you move to a voucher system, you are
            putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance
            companies.

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 32-34]

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.

 ** OBAMA:  And over time, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; they&#39;re stuck.

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 48-50]

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt; we leave the economy|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 52-54]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the case, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; it will always be the
            best product that people can purchase.

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 56-58]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: Can we can the two of you agree that the voters have a
            choice a clear choice &lt;&lt;between&gt;&gt; the two|

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 67-69]

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start.

 ** LEHRER: And we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, and &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; we&#39;re going
            to go to health care, OK?

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 75-77]

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;At the same time&gt;&gt;, regulation can become excessive.

    LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think? 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 79-81]

    ROMNEY: Other places, no.

 ** LEHRER: Like &lt;&lt;where&gt;&gt;?

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed &lt;&lt;during&gt;&gt; the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy.

    ROMNEY: Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; they weren&#39;t.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 120-122]

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

 ** OBAMA:  Because &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you do, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you give a mortgage
            that&#39;s not qualified, there are big penalties, except
            they didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference &lt;&lt;between&gt;&gt; the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care &lt;&lt;where&gt;&gt; I know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; you look
            at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 160-162]

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And as a matter of fact, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; the president ran for
            office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought
            down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two
            thousand five hundred a family.

    ROMNEY: Instead, it&#39;s gone up by that amount. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 174-176]

    ROMNEY: And the best course for health care is to do what we did
            in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits
            the needs of the state.

 ** ROMNEY: And &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; let&#39;s focus on getting the costs down for
            people, rather than raising it with the dollar two
            thousand five hundred additional premium.

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal? 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; I was running for office,
            I was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 177-179]

    OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around and having those same conversations
            that Governor Romney talks about.

 ** OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; they wanted to provide it to their employees.

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage

            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 179-181]

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; they had a pre existing condition, they might not
            be able to get coverage at all.

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 180-182]

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

    OBAMA:  And so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their premiums,
            somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don&#39;t have
            enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance
            companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve got health insurance, it
            doesn&#39;t mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan &lt;&lt;until&gt;&gt; you&#39;re twenty six years
            old.

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt; you interrupted
            me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

===================================
Event 1: [lines 12-14]

    ROMNEY: They&#39;ll have at least two plans.

 ** ROMNEY: And by the way, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; the government can be as efficient
            as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low
            as the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find
            a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 23-25]

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

 ** ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; we can&#39;t get competition
            into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice
            of different plans at lower cost, better quality.

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; I &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; I can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:  And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 32-34]

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.

 ** OBAMA:  And over time, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck.

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 52-54]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; that&#39;s the case, then it will always be the best
            product that people can purchase.

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 75-77]

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;At the same time&gt;&gt;, regulation can become excessive.

    LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think? 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 120-122]

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

 ** OBAMA:  Because &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you give a mortgage
            that&#39;s not qualified, there are big penalties, except
            they didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 177-179]

    OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around and having those same conversations
            that Governor Romney talks about.

 ** OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; they wanted to provide it to their employees.

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.

 ** OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt;
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 179-181]

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; they had a pre existing condition, they might not
            be able to get coverage at all.

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 180-182]

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;If&gt;&gt; they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

    OBAMA:  And so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their premiums,
            somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don&#39;t have
            enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance
            companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you&#39;ve got health insurance, it
            doesn&#39;t mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

 ** OBAMA:  Number two, &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than &lt;&lt;if&gt;&gt; you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:  Now, the last point I&#39;d make before|

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 67-69]

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start.

 ** LEHRER: And we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, and &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; we&#39;re going
            to go to health care, OK?

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 120-122]

            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 174-176]

    ROMNEY: And the best course for health care is to do what we did
            in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits
            the needs of the state.

 ** ROMNEY: And &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; let&#39;s focus on getting the costs down for
            people, rather than raising it with the dollar two
            thousand five hundred additional premium.

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt; we leave the economy|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 56-58]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: Can we can the two of you agree that the voters have a
            choice a clear choice &lt;&lt;between&gt;&gt; the two|

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 79-81]

    ROMNEY: Other places, no.

 ** LEHRER: Like &lt;&lt;where&gt;&gt;?

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed &lt;&lt;during&gt;&gt; the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy.

    ROMNEY: Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; they weren&#39;t.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference &lt;&lt;between&gt;&gt; the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care &lt;&lt;where&gt;&gt; I know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; you look
            at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 160-162]

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And as a matter of fact, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; the president ran for
            office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought
            down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two
            thousand five hundred a family.

    ROMNEY: Instead, it&#39;s gone up by that amount. 
 
===================================

            old.
