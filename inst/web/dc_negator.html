$negator
===================================
Event 1: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What I support is &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt; change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 8-10]

    ROMNEY: Their choice.

 ** ROMNEY: They get to choose and they&#39;ll have at least two plans
            that will be entirely at &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt; cost to them.

    ROMNEY: So they don&#39;t have to pay additional money, no additional
            dollar six thousand. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 9-11]

    ROMNEY: They get to choose and they&#39;ll have at least two plans
            that will be entirely at no cost to them.

 ** ROMNEY: So they &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have to pay additional money, &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt;
            additional dollar six thousand.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s not going to happen. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 10-12]

    ROMNEY: So they don&#39;t have to pay additional money, no additional
            dollar six thousand.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; going to happen.

    ROMNEY: They&#39;ll have at least two plans. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; have the government telling me
            what kind of health care I get.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; like them, I can get rid of them and find
            a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 22-24]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that I&#39;ve put forward.

 ** ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; even from Paul Ryan
            or or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 23-25]

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

 ** ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; get competition
            into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice
            of different plans at lower cost, better quality.

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 36-38]

    OBAMA:  One last point I want to make.

 ** OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; just
            in Medicare and Medicaid|

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 66-68]

    LEHRER: Beginning with you.

 ** LEHRER: This is &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; a new two minute segment to start.

    LEHRER: And we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, and then we&#39;re going to
            go to health care, OK? 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: You &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; have a free market work if you &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            have regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 72-74]

    ROMNEY: I needed them there.

 ** ROMNEY: You &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

    ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have
            an economy work. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 78-80]

    ROMNEY: In some places, yes.

 ** ROMNEY: Other places, &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: Like where? 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 80-82]

    LEHRER: Like where?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;No&gt;&gt;, it can become out of date.

    ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed during the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that I
            think has some &lt;&lt;unintended&gt;&gt; consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 94-96]

    ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it.

 ** ROMNEY: We&#39;re &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; going to get rid of all regulation.

    ROMNEY: You have to have regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 101-103]

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s talk|

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;No&gt;&gt;, let&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 105-107]

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, it &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; just on Wall Street.

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 107-109]

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

 ** OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; afford.

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they &lt;&lt;weren&#39;t&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; even &lt;&lt;understand&gt;&gt;, in order to make big
            profits, but knowing that it made the entire system
            vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 113-115]

    OBAMA:  We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
            capital requirements.

 ** OBAMA:  You &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; engage in some of this risky behavior that
            is putting Main Street at risk.

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; what I believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 122-124]

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe.

 ** ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; that&#39;s just &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; the
            facts.

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But I &lt;&lt;wouldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 126-128]

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the &lt;&lt;unintended&gt;&gt; consequences of Dodd
            Frank.

    ROMNEY: It wasn&#39;t thought through properly. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 127-129]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: It &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; thought through properly.

    ROMNEY: We need to get rid of that provision because it&#39;s killing
            regional and small banks. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 131-133]

    ROMNEY: Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: You say we were giving mortgages to people who
            &lt;&lt;weren&#39;t&gt;&gt; qualified.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s exactly right. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; qualified, there are big penalties, except they
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 136-138]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years.

 ** ROMNEY: We &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; know what a qualified mortgage is yet.

    ROMNEY: So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 139-141]

    ROMNEY: Try and get a mortgage these days.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; anticipate putting in place the kinds of
            regulations you have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 140-142]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you
            have to have.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too
            much regulation.

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 141-143]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: Sometimes they &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; come out with a clear
            regulation.

    ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring
            back housing and get good jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: I will make sure we &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because I want to
            bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            afford it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 40: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, &lt;&lt;unfortunately&gt;&gt;, when when when you look at
            Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 41: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 42: [lines 167-169]

    ROMNEY: I want to put that money back in Medicare for our
            seniors.

 ** ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an &lt;&lt;unelected&gt;&gt; board
            that&#39;s going to tell people ultimately what kind of
            treatments they can have.

    ROMNEY: I don&#39;t like that idea. 
 
===================================
Event 43: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 44: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: I just &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising &lt;&lt;unemployment&gt;&gt;, an economic crisis at the
            at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion
            for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting
            for jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 45: [lines 177-179]

    OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around and having those same conversations
            that Governor Romney talks about.

 ** OBAMA:  And it &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; get affordable
            coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
            employees.

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country. 
 
===================================
Event 46: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing

            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 47: [lines 179-181]

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

 ** OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt;
            be able to get coverage at all.

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit. 
 
===================================
Event 48: [lines 180-182]

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all.

 ** OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            &lt;&lt;impose&gt;&gt; an arbitrary limit.

    OBAMA:  And so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their premiums,
            somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don&#39;t have
            enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance
            companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit. 
 
===================================

            have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance
            companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country. 
 
===================================
Event 50: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it
            &lt;&lt;doesn&#39;t&gt;&gt; mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 51: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; jerk you
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. 
 
===================================
Event 52: [lines 188-190]

    OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around.

 ** OBAMA:  They &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;impose&gt;&gt; arbitrary lifetime limits.

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old. 
 
===================================
Event 53: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan &lt;&lt;until&gt;&gt; you&#39;re twenty six years
            old.

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care. 
 
===================================
Event 54: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

 ** OBAMA:  Number two, if you &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:  Now, the last point I&#39;d make before| 
 
===================================
Event 55: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;No&gt;&gt;, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted
            me, was the &lt;&lt;irony&gt;&gt; is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 56: [lines 195-197]

    OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me,
            was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work really
            well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good
            thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what
            is essentially the identical model and as a consequence
            people are covered there.

 ** OBAMA:  It &lt;&lt;hasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; destroyed jobs.

    OBAMA:  And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we
            have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as
            opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the
            cold.

 ** ROMNEY: What I support is &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt; change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 8-10]

    ROMNEY: Their choice.

 ** ROMNEY: They get to choose and they&#39;ll have at least two plans
            that will be entirely at &lt;&lt;no&gt;&gt; cost to them.

    ROMNEY: So they don&#39;t have to pay additional money, no additional

            what kind of health care I get.

            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 36-38]

    OBAMA:  One last point I want to make.

            in Medicare and Medicaid|

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.

            been passed during the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 94-96]

    ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it.

 ** ROMNEY: We&#39;re &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; going to get rid of all regulation.

            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; what I believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 122-124]

            facts.

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; qualified, there are big penalties, except they
            didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage
            was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 140-142]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you
            have to have.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt; that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too
            much regulation.

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 179-181]

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

 ** OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might &lt;&lt;not&gt;&gt;
            be able to get coverage at all.

===================================
Event 1: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that I
            think has some &lt;&lt;unintended&gt;&gt; consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even &lt;&lt;understand&gt;&gt;, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 126-128]

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the &lt;&lt;unintended&gt;&gt; consequences of Dodd
            Frank.

    ROMNEY: It wasn&#39;t thought through properly. 
 
===================================

            was the &lt;&lt;irony&gt;&gt; is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

===================================
Event 1: [lines 9-11]

    ROMNEY: They get to choose and they&#39;ll have at least two plans
            that will be entirely at no cost to them.

 ** ROMNEY: So they &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have to pay additional money, no
            additional dollar six thousand.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s not going to happen. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; like them, I can get rid of them and find
            a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 23-25]

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

 ** ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; get competition
            into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice
            of different plans at lower cost, better quality.

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: You &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; have a free market work if you &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            have regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 72-74]

    ROMNEY: I needed them there.

 ** ROMNEY: You &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

    ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have
            an economy work. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 105-107]

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, it &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; just on Wall Street.

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 107-109]

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

 ** OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; afford.

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they &lt;&lt;weren&#39;t&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; even understand, in order to make big profits,
            but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 113-115]

    OBAMA:  We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
            capital requirements.

 ** OBAMA:  You &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; engage in some of this risky behavior that
            is putting Main Street at risk.

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But I &lt;&lt;wouldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 127-129]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: It &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; thought through properly.

    ROMNEY: We need to get rid of that provision because it&#39;s killing
            regional and small banks. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 131-133]

    ROMNEY: Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: You say we were giving mortgages to people who
            &lt;&lt;weren&#39;t&gt;&gt; qualified.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s exactly right. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            not qualified, there are big penalties, except they
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 136-138]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years.

 ** ROMNEY: We &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; know what a qualified mortgage is yet.

    ROMNEY: So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 139-141]

    ROMNEY: Try and get a mortgage these days.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank
            &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; anticipate putting in place the kinds of
            regulations you have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 141-143]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: Sometimes they &lt;&lt;didn&#39;t&gt;&gt; come out with a clear
            regulation.

    ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring
            back housing and get good jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: I will make sure we &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because I want to
            bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            afford it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: I &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: I just &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at
            the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for
            two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for
            jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 177-179]

    OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I
            was traveling around and having those same conversations
            that Governor Romney talks about.

 ** OBAMA:  And it &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they &lt;&lt;couldn&#39;t&gt;&gt; get affordable
            coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
            employees.

    OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
            was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.

 ** OBAMA:  It &lt;&lt;wasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; just that this was the biggest driver of
            our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but
            it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 181-183]

    OBAMA:  If they did have coverage, insurance companies might
            impose an arbitrary limit.

 ** OBAMA:  And so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their premiums,
            somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt;
            have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance
            companies say that they&#39;ve hit the limit.

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it
            &lt;&lt;doesn&#39;t&gt;&gt; mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; jerk you
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 188-190]

    OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around.

 ** OBAMA:  They &lt;&lt;can&#39;t&gt;&gt; impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

 ** OBAMA:  Number two, if you &lt;&lt;don&#39;t&gt;&gt; have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:  Now, the last point I&#39;d make before| 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 195-197]

    OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me,
            was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work really
            well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good
            thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what
            is essentially the identical model and as a consequence
            people are covered there.

 ** OBAMA:  It &lt;&lt;hasn&#39;t&gt;&gt; destroyed jobs.

    OBAMA:  And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we
            have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as
            opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the
            cold.
