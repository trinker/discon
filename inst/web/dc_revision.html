===================================
Event 1: [lines 1-3]

    LEHRER: We&#39;ll talk about specifically about health care in a
            moment.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

    ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near
            retirees to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 17-19]

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; people make their own choice.

    ROMNEY: The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 19-21]

    ROMNEY: The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?

 ** ROMNEY: We have to have the benefits high for those that are low
            income, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; for higher income people, we&#39;re going to
            have to lower some of the benefits.

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 22-24]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that I&#39;ve put forward.

 ** ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; also it came from
            Bill Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff.

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 38-40]

    LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; overall.

    LEHRER: OK. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; all I want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 54-56]

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; my experience my experience the private sector
            typically is able to provide a better product at a lower
            cost.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 99-101]

    LEHRER: Well, here&#39;s a specific|

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; let&#39;s let&#39;s mention let me mention the other one.

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s talk| 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt;
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 118-120]

    OBAMA:  And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got some
            agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some
            regulation.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; in the past, Governor Romney has said he just
            want to repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back.

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street? 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; that&#39;s not what I believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 122-124]

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe.

 ** ROMNEY: Sorry, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt; that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts.

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
            not qualified, there are big penalties, &lt;&lt;except&gt;&gt; they
            didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage
            was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees.

 ** OBAMA:  It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
            federal deficit, our overall health care costs, &lt;&lt;but&gt;&gt;
            it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if
            they got sick, millions of families, all across the
            country.

    OBAMA:  If they had a pre existing condition, they might not be
            able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;But&gt;&gt; it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.
