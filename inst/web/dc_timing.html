===================================
Event 1: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are &lt;&lt;generally&gt;&gt; pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 31-33]

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

 ** OBAMA:  And &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; you move to a voucher system, you are
            putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance
            companies.

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 32-34]

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies.

 ** OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; they&#39;re stuck.

    OBAMA:  And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan
            would weaken Medicare substantially. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 35-37]

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took.

 ** OBAMA:  One &lt;&lt;last&gt;&gt; point I want to make.

    OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare and Medicaid| 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 48-50]

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt; we leave the economy|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 52-54]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** ROMNEY: If that&#39;s the case, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; it will &lt;&lt;always&gt;&gt; be the
            best product that people can purchase.

    LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 62-64]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is
            your view about the level of federal regulation of the
            economy right &lt;&lt;now&gt;&gt;?

    LEHRER: Is there too much? 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 67-69]

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start.

 ** LEHRER: And we&#39;ll go for a few minutes, and &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; we&#39;re going
            to go to health care, OK?

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 75-77]

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;At the same time&gt;&gt;, regulation can become excessive.

    LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think? 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 76-78]

    ROMNEY: At the same time, regulation can become excessive.

 ** LEHRER: Is it excessive &lt;&lt;now&gt;&gt;, do you think?

    ROMNEY: In some places, yes. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed &lt;&lt;during&gt;&gt; the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy.

    ROMNEY: Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 105-107]

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;Now&gt;&gt;, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; they weren&#39;t.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 115-117]

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;In the meantime&gt;&gt;, by the way, we also made sure that
            all the help that we provided those banks was paid back
            every single dime, with interest.

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 116-118]

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;Now&gt;&gt;, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

    OBAMA:  And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got some
            agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some
            regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 120-122]

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

 ** OBAMA:  Because if you do, &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 140-142]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you
            have to have.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank &lt;&lt;always&gt;&gt; was wrong with too
            much regulation.

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 141-143]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;Sometimes&gt;&gt; they didn&#39;t come out with a clear
            regulation.

    ROMNEY: I will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our of
            our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring
            back housing and get good jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;Now&gt;&gt;, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; you look
            at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 160-162]

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And as a matter of fact, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; the president ran for
            office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought
            down the cost of insurance for each family by dollar two
            thousand five hundred a family.

    ROMNEY: Instead, it&#39;s gone up by that amount. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 174-176]

    ROMNEY: And the best course for health care is to do what we did
            in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits
            the needs of the state.

 ** ROMNEY: And &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; let&#39;s focus on getting the costs down for
            people, rather than raising it with the dollar two
            thousand five hundred additional premium.

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal? 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, &lt;&lt;when&gt;&gt; I was running for office,
            I was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan &lt;&lt;until&gt;&gt; you&#39;re twenty six years
            old.

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 192-194]

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;Now&gt;&gt;, the &lt;&lt;last&gt;&gt; point I&#39;d make &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt;|

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds &lt;&lt;before&gt;&gt; you interrupted
            me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 196-198]

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

 ** OBAMA:  And as a consequence, we &lt;&lt;now&gt;&gt; have a system in which
            we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as
            opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the
            cold.

    LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 199-200]

    LEHRER: All right, Governor.

 ** LEHRER: Governor, tell tell the president &lt;&lt;directly&gt;&gt; why you
            think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?
