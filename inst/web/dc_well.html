    <h2>Arguments</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>text.var</dt>
      <dd>The text variable.</dd>
      <dt>grouping.var</dt>
      <dd>The grouping variables.  Also takes a single
grouping variable or a list of 1 or more grouping variables.</dd>
      <dt>n.before</dt>
      <dd>The number of rows before the indexed occurrence.</dd>
      <dt>tot</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> condenses sub-units (e.g., sentences)
into turns of talk for that <code>grouping.var</code>.</dd>
      <dt>n.after</dt>
      <dd>The number of rows after the indexed occurrence.</dd>
      <dt>ord.inds</dt>
      <dd>logical.  If <code>TRUE</code> inds is ordered least to greatest.</dd>
      <dt>markup</dt>
      <dd>A character vector of length two indicating the left (element
1) and right (element 2) boundary markers to use to highlight the well
discourse connectors.  Use <code>c("", "")</code> to not mark the well discourse
markers.</dd>
      <dt>name</dt>
      <dd>A string indicating the name to search for within the internal
data sets, typically the function's name.  Generally, for internal use.</dd>
      <dt>fun1</dt>
      <dd>A function that checks the text variable and returns a logical
vector.  This allows for additional restrictions to be places upon the text
beyond the limited (non-regex) capabilities of <code><a href='http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/qdap/docs/termco'>termco</a></code> and
<code><a href='http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/qdap/docs/trans_context'>trans_context</a></code>.  The function in <code>dc_well_begin</code>
ensures that each has no more than n words before the "well".  The defaut number
of words is 0 or less.  This can be changed by supplying an argument to
<code>n</code> via <code>control</code>.  For example to set the number of words to 2
use: <code>control = list(n = 2))</code>.</dd>
      <dt>fun2</dt>
      <dd>A function that checks the grouping variable and returns a logical
vector.  This allows for additional restrictions to be placed upon the
grouping variables that can't be addressed by <code><a href='http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/qdap/docs/termco'>termco</a></code> and
<code><a href='http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/qdap/docs/trans_context'>trans_context</a></code>.  This argument in <code>dc_well_begin</code>
is a function (<code>is.first_in_set</code>) that checks to ensure
that the occurrence of well is the first sentence in that group
(<code>grouping.var</code>) turn of talk.  The arguments sent to
<code>is.first_in_set</code> (<code>regex.term</code> & <code>n</code>) can be
changed via setting <code>regex.term</code> & <code>n</code> withing a list supplied to
<code>control</code>.  For example to set the number of words to 2
use: <code>control = list(n = 2))</code>.  To change both:
<code>control = list(n = 1, regex.term = "Well"))</code></dd>
      <dt>inds</dt>
      <dd>A list of integer indices to print context for.</dd>
      <dt>...</dt>

===================================
Event 1: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER:  Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, I would repeal and replace it.

    ROMNEY:  We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 98-100]

    ROMNEY:  You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits
             for|

 ** LEHRER:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, here&#39;s a specific|

    ROMNEY:  But let&#39;s let&#39;s mention let me mention the other one. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 152-154]

    ROMNEY:  I sure do.

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

    ROMNEY:  You know, I was in New Hampshire. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER:  Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, four years ago, when I was running for office,
             I was traveling around and having those same
             conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:   And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
             costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable
             coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
             employees. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER:  Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:   No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted
             me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
             really &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt; in Massachusetts, because Governor
             Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the
             state to set up what is essentially the identical model
             and as a consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:   It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 200-202]

    LEHRER:  Governor, tell tell the president directly why you think
             what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, I did with my first statement.

    ROMNEY:  First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 251-253]

    LEHRER:  Let&#39;s let the governor explain what you would do|

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;|

    LEHRER:  if Obamacare is repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 254-256]

    LEHRER:  How would you replace it?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, actually it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a lengthy description.

    ROMNEY:  But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered
             under my plan. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 270-272]

    ROMNEY:  We instead need to put insurance plans, providers,
             hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an
             incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an
             excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that&#39;s
             happening.

 ** ROMNEY:  Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt;, Mayo
             Clinic is doing it superbly &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt;, Cleveland Clinic,
             others.

    ROMNEY:  But the right answer is not to have the federal
             government take over health care and start mandating to
             the providers across America, telling a patient and a
             doctor what kind of treatment they can have. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 277-279]

    OBAMA:   But let&#39;s go back to what Governor Romney indicated,
             that under his plan, he would be able to cover people
             with preexisting conditions.

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, actually Governor, that isn&#39;t what your plan
             does.

    OBAMA:   What your plan does is to duplicate what&#39;s already the
             law, which says if you are out of health insurance for
             three months, then you can end up getting continuous
             coverage and an insurance company can&#39;t deny you if
             you&#39;ve if it&#39;s been under ninety days. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 329-331]

    LEHRER:  Do you believe, both of you but you had the first two
             minutes on this, Mister President do you believe there&#39;s
             a fundamental difference between the two of you as to
             how you view the mission of the federal government?

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, I definitely think there are differences.

    LEHRER:  And do you yeah. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 353-355]

    LEHRER:  Your view?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, first, I love great schools.

    ROMNEY:  Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all
             fifty states. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 384-386]

    LEHRER:  Does the federal government have a responsibility to
             improve the quality of public education in America?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, the primary responsibility for education is
             is, of course, at the state and local level.

    ROMNEY:  But the federal government also can play a very
             important role. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 392-394]

    LEHRER:  How do you see the federal government&#39;s responsibility
             to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education
             in this country?

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, as I&#39;ve indicated, I think that it has a
             significant role to play.

    OBAMA:   Through our Race to the Top program, we&#39;ve worked with
             Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major
             reforms, and they&#39;re having an impact right now. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 448-450]

    OBAMA:   You&#39;ve done a great job.

 ** LEHRER:  Oh, &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt;, no.

    LEHRER:  But the fact is government the role of government and
             governing, we&#39;ve lost a pod in other words. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 460-462]

    LEHRER:  But what would you do as president?

 ** ROMNEY:  We as president, I will sit on day one actually, the day
             after I get elected I&#39;ll sit down with leaders the
             Democratic leaders, as &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt; as Republican leaders,
             and continue as we did in my state we met every Monday
             for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the
             challenges in the in the in our state in that case.

    ROMNEY:  We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because
             we&#39;re going to compromise our principle, but because
             there&#39;s common ground. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 471-473]

    LEHRER:  Mister President?

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, first of all, I think Governor Romney&#39;s going
             to have a busy first day, because he&#39;s also going to
             repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among
             Democrats as you&#39;re sitting down with them.

    OBAMA:   But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas
             from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they&#39;re
             advancing the cause of making middle class families
             stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle
             class. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 491-493]

    LEHRER:  Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go
             last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mister
             President.

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank
             Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate,
             and I very much appreciate it.

    OBAMA:   And I want to thank the University of Denver. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 625-627]

    OBAMA:   And let&#39;s take the money that we&#39;ve been spending on war
             over the last decade to rebuild America, roads, bridges
             schools.

 ** OBAMA:   We do those things, not only is your future going to be
             bright but America&#39;s future is going to bright as
             &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt;.

    CROWLEY: Let me ask you for more immediate answer and begin with
             Mister Romney just quickly what what can you do? 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 630-632]

    CROWLEY: What about those long term unemployed who need a job
             right now?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt; what you&#39;re seeing in this country is twenty
             three million people struggling to find a job.

    ROMNEY:  And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of
             work for a long, long, long time. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 647-649]

    ROMNEY:  And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit
             bankrupt.

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, the president took Detroit bankrupt.

    ROMNEY:  You took General Motors bankrupt. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 711-713]

    CROWLEY: Governor, on the subject of gas prices?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, let&#39;s look at the president&#39;s policies, all
             right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we&#39;ve had
             four years of policies being played out.

    ROMNEY:  And the president&#39;s right in terms of the additional oil
             production, but none of it came on federal land. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 717-719]

    ROMNEY:  So where&#39;d the increase come from?

 ** ROMNEY:  &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt; a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North
             Dakota.

    ROMNEY:  What was his participation there? 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 733-735]

    ROMNEY:  That&#39;s not the right course for America.

 ** ROMNEY:  Let&#39;s take advantage of the energy resources we have, as
             &lt;&lt;well&gt;&gt; as the energy ources for the future.

    ROMNEY:  And if we do that, if we do what I&#39;m planning on doing,
             which is getting us energy independent, North America
             energy independence within eight years, you&#39;re going to
             see manufacturing jobs come back. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 803-805]

    ROMNEY:  I&#39;m still speaking.

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt; |

    ROMNEY:  And the answer is I don&#39;t believe people think that&#39;s
             the case| 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 825-827]

    CROWLEY: Is that true?

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, think about what the governor think about what
             the governor just said.

    OBAMA:   He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was
             dollar one. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 941-943]

    OBAMA:   Not only that, he said, I think that&#39;s what grows the
             economy.

 ** OBAMA:   &lt;&lt;Well&gt;&gt;, I fundamentally disagree with that.

    OBAMA:   I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax
             credit that we put in place for your kids going to
             college.
