Event 1: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; support is no change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 6-8]

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young,
            what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in
            place for them is to allow them either to choose the
            current Medicare program or a private plan.

    ROMNEY: Their choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 13-15]

    ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as
            the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as
            the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know my own view is &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather have a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; just assume not have the government telling me
            what kind of health care &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; get.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 15-17]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather be able to have an insurance company.

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like them, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can get rid of them and
            find a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 21-23]

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; put forward.

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 24-26]

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe in competition.

    OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 35-37]

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took.

 ** OBAMA:  One last point &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to make.

    OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare and Medicaid| 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 44-46]

    OBAMA:  Is that a is that a separate topic?

 ** LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to get to it.

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 45-47]

    LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, I want to get to it.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m&gt;&gt; sorry.

    LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly| 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: But all &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 70-72]

    ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work if you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: As a businessperson, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had to have &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; need to know
            the regulations.

    ROMNEY: I needed them there. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 71-73]

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; needed them there.

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; mean, you have to have regulations so that you can
            have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think has some unintended consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 86-88]

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government.

 ** ROMNEY: This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New York
            banks &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; ever seen.

    ROMNEY: This is an enormous boon for them. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY: Well, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; would repeal and replace it.

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 103-105]

    LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think this is a great example.

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, you know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 124-126]

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s why &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; have regulation.

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want
            to bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think we have another clear difference between the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 151-153]

    LEHRER: Why?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; sure do.

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: You know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; gone to that
            are saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 166-168]

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to put that money back in Medicare for our
            seniors.

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; just don&#39;t know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at
            the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for
            two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for
            jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was running for office,
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 192-194]

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, the last point &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; make before|

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir. 
 
===================================

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had five seconds before you

            model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor
            Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the

Event 1: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; support is no change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 6-8]

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young,
            what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in
            place for them is to allow them either to choose the
            current Medicare program or a private plan.

    ROMNEY: Their choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 13-15]

    ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as
            the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as
            the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know my own view is &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather have a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; just assume not have the government telling me
            what kind of health care &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; get.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 15-17]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather be able to have an insurance company.

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like them, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can get rid of them and
            find a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 21-23]

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; put forward.

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 24-26]

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe in competition.

    OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 35-37]

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took.

 ** OBAMA:  One last point &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to make.

    OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare and Medicaid| 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 44-46]

    OBAMA:  Is that a is that a separate topic?

 ** LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to get to it.

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 45-47]

    LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, I want to get to it.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m&gt;&gt; sorry.

    LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly| 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: But all &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 70-72]

    ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work if you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: As a businessperson, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had to have &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; need to know
            the regulations.

    ROMNEY: I needed them there. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 71-73]

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; needed them there.

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; mean, you have to have regulations so that you can
            have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think has some unintended consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 86-88]

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government.

 ** ROMNEY: This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New York
            banks &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; ever seen.

    ROMNEY: This is an enormous boon for them. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY: Well, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; would repeal and replace it.

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 103-105]

    LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think this is a great example.

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, you know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 124-126]

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s why &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; have regulation.

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want
            to bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think we have another clear difference between the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 151-153]

    LEHRER: Why?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; sure do.

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: You know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; gone to that
            are saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 166-168]

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to put that money back in Medicare for our
            seniors.

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; just don&#39;t know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at
            the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for
            two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for
            jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was running for office,
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 192-194]

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, the last point &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; make before|

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had five seconds before you
            interrupted me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this
            model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor

<div class='output'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 1-3]

    LEHRER: We&#39;ll talk about specifically about health care in a
            moment.

 ** LEHRER: But what do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; support the voucher system, Governor?

    ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near
            retirees to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 29-31]

    OBAMA:  That&#39;s what they do.

 ** OBAMA:  And so &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:  And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:  And if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 31-33]

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

            putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance
            companies.

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 56-58]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: Can we can the two of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; agree that the voters have
            a choice a clear choice between the two|

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 58-60]

    ROMNEY: Absolutely.

 ** LEHRER: of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; on Medicare?

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 65-67]

    LEHRER: And in your case, Mister President, is there should there
            be more?

 ** LEHRER: Beginning with &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; can&#39;t have a free market work if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; don&#39;t
            have regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 72-74]

    ROMNEY: I needed them there.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

    ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have
            an economy work. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in

 ** ROMNEY: I mean, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; have to have regulations so that &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            can have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 76-78]

    ROMNEY: At the same time, regulation can become excessive.

 ** LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; think?

    ROMNEY: In some places, yes. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed during the president&#39;s term, &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy.

    ROMNEY: Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 82-84]

    ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed during the president&#39;s term, you&#39;ve seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the
            economy.

 ** ROMNEY: Let me give &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; an example.

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 92-94]

    ROMNEY: In Dodd Frank|

 ** LEHRER: Do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; want to repeal Dodd Frank?

    ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 95-97]

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; have to have regulation.

    ROMNEY: And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the
            sense in the world. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 97-99]

    ROMNEY: And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the
            sense in the world.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; need transparency, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; need to have leverage
            limits for|

    LEHRER: Well, here&#39;s a specific| 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 107-109]

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had people who were borrowing money to buy a
            house that they couldn&#39;t afford.

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had credit agencies that were stamping these as
            Aone great investments when they weren&#39;t.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 112-114]

    OBAMA:  We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street
            since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys.

 ** OBAMA:  We said &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got banks, &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got to raise
            your capital requirements.

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 113-115]

    OBAMA:  We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
            capital requirements.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that
            is putting Main Street at risk.

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got to have a
            living will so so we can know how &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; going to
            wind things down if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; make a bad bet so we don&#39;t
            have other taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; know, I appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 120-122]

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

 ** OBAMA:  Because if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 131-133]

    ROMNEY: Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; say we were giving mortgages to people who
            weren&#39;t qualified.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s exactly right. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; give a mortgage
            that&#39;s not qualified, there are big penalties, except
            they didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 139-141]

    ROMNEY: Try and get a mortgage these days.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations
            &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 147-149]

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each.

 ** LEHRER: And &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; go first, Governor Romney.

    LEHRER: You want it repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 148-150]

    LEHRER: And you go first, Governor Romney.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; want it repealed.

    LEHRER: You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 149-151]

    LEHRER: You want it repealed.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; want the Affordable Care Act repealed.

    LEHRER: Why? 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; know, I was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, when when when &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; look at
            Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 183-185]

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

 ** OBAMA:  And let me tell &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; exactly what Obamacare did.

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover. 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, if &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got health insurance, it
            doesn&#39;t mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 185-187]

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; keep your own insurance.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 186-188]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; keep your own doctor.

    OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. 
 
===================================
Event 40: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:  They have to let &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; twenty six years
            old.

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care. 
 
===================================
Event 41: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  And it also says that &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; going to have to get
            rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market. 
 
===================================
Event 42: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

 ** OBAMA:  Number two, if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            to benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:  Now, the last point I&#39;d make before| 
 
===================================
Event 43: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; interrupted
            me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 44: [lines 199-200]

    LEHRER: All right, Governor.

 ** LEHRER: Governor, tell tell the president directly why &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?

    ROMNEY:    What I support is no change for current retirees and
               near retirees to Medicare.

 ** ROMNEY:    And the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; supports taking &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; seven
               &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; sixteen billion out of that program.

    LEHRER:    And what about the vouchers? 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 9-11]

    ROMNEY:    They get to choose and they&#39;ll have at least two plans
               that will be entirely at no cost to them.

 ** ROMNEY:    So they don&#39;t have to pay additional money, no
               additional &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; six &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s not going to happen.

===================================
Event 4: [lines 12-14]

    ROMNEY:    They&#39;ll have at least two plans.

 ** ROMNEY:    And by the way, if the &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; can be as
               efficient as the private sector and offer premiums
               that are as low as the private sector, people will be
               happy to get traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able
               to get a private plan.

    ROMNEY:    I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY:    I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;d just assume not have the &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; telling me
               what kind of health care I get.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 19-21]

    ROMNEY:    The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?

 ** ROMNEY:    We have to have the benefits high for &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that
               are low income, but for higher income people, we&#39;re
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to lower some of the benefits.

    ROMNEY:    We have to make sure this program is there for the
               long term. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:     And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
               profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:     And if you are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to save any money through
               what Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen
               is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:     And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
               seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================

               fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================

===================================
Event 11: [lines 50-52]

    ROMNEY:    Let&#39;s get back to Medicare.

 ** ROMNEY:    The &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; said that the &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; can
               provide the service at lower cost and without a
               profit.

    LEHRER:    All right.

 ** LEHRER:    So to finish quickly, briefly, on the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;,
               what is your view about the level of federal

    ROMNEY:    Regulation is essential. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
               their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY:    I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can
               have an &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; work.

===================================

    ROMNEY:    No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY:    And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation
               that&#39;s been passed during the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s term,
               you&#39;ve seen regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt
               it&#39;s hurt the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    Let me give you an example. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY:    Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY:    And it includes within it a number of provisions that
               I think has some unintended consequences that are
               harmful to the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
               fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the
               federal government. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 85-87]

    ROMNEY:    And it includes within it a number of provisions that
               I think has some unintended consequences that are
               harmful to the economy.

 ** ROMNEY:    One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
               fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the
               federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New
               York banks I&#39;ve ever seen. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 88-90]

    ROMNEY:    This is an enormous boon for them.

 ** ROMNEY:    There&#39;ve been one &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; twenty two community and
               small banks have closed since Dodd Frank.

    ROMNEY:    So there&#39;s one example. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 94-96]

    ROMNEY:    Well, I would repeal and replace it.

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to get rid of all regulation.

    ROMNEY:    You have to have regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 102-104]

    LEHRER:    No, let&#39;s not.

 ** LEHRER:    Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
               specific on Dodd Frank and what the &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; just
               said.

    OBAMA:     I think this is a great example. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 111-113]

    OBAMA:     So what did we do?

 ** OBAMA:     We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall
               Street since the one &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; nine &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt;
               thirtys.

    OBAMA:     We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
               capital requirements. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:     You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that
               is putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:     We&#39;ve &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a
               living will so so we can know how you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t
               have other taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:     In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that
               all the help that we provided those banks was paid
               back every single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 115-117]

    OBAMA:     We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a
               living will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind
               things down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have
               other taxpayer bailouts.

 ** OBAMA:     In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that
               all the help that we provided &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; banks was paid
               back every single dime, with interest.

    OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
               Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 119-121]

    OBAMA:     But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want
               to repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back.

 ** OBAMA:     And so the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; is: Does anybody out there
               think that the big problem we had is that there was
               too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

    OBAMA:     Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
               candidate. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 135-137]

    ROMNEY:    And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
               qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that&#39;s
               not qualified, there are big penalties, except they
               didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage
               was.

 ** ROMNEY:    It&#39;s been two &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY:    And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY:    And, unfortunately, when when when you look at
               Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
               will cost &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; five &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt;
               a year more than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY:    So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 160-162]

    ROMNEY:    So it&#39;s adding to cost.

 ** ROMNEY:    And as a matter of fact, when the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; ran
               for office, he said that, by this year, he would have
               brought down the cost of insurance for each family by
               &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; five &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; a family.

    ROMNEY:    Instead, it&#39;s gone up by that amount. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 165-167]

    ROMNEY:    So that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t want it.

 ** ROMNEY:    Second reason, it cuts &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; seven &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt;
               sixteen billion from Medicare to pay for it.

    ROMNEY:    I want to put that money back in Medicare for our
               seniors. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 167-169]

    ROMNEY:    I want to put that money back in Medicare for our
               seniors.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number three, it puts in place an unelected board
               that&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to tell people ultimately what kind
               of treatments they can have.

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t like that idea. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 169-171]

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t like that idea.

 ** ROMNEY:    Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
               across the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;, said, what&#39;s been the effect
               of Obamacare on your hiring plans?

    ROMNEY:    And three quarters of them said it makes us less
               likely to hire people. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY:    And three quarters of them said it makes us less
               likely to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY:    I just don&#39;t know how the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; could have
               come into office, facing twenty three million people
               out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis
               at the at the kitchen table, and spend his &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;
               and passion for two &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; fighting for Obamacare
               instead of fighting for jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY:    It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 174-176]

    ROMNEY:    And the best course for health care is to do what we
               did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that
               fits the needs of the state.

 ** ROMNEY:    And then let&#39;s focus on getting the costs down for
               people, rather than raising it with the &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; two
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; five &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; additional premium.

    LEHRER:    Mister President, the argument against repeal? 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER:    Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:     Well, four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, when I was running for
               office, I was traveling around and having &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt;
               same conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:     And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
               costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable
               coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
               employees. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 178-180]

    OBAMA:     And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
               costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable
               coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their
               employees.

 ** OBAMA:     It wasn&#39;t just that this was the biggest driver of our
               federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it
               was families who were worried about &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; bankrupt
               if they got sick, millions of families, all across the
               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     If they had a pre existing condition, they might not
               be able to get coverage at all. 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 182-184]

    OBAMA:     And so as a consequence, they&#39;re paying their
               premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold,
               they don&#39;t have enough money to pay the bills, because
               the insurance companies say that they&#39;ve hit the
               limit.

 ** OBAMA:     So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
               because this is part of making sure that &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt;
               class families are secure in this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:     And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:     Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
               mean a &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; takeover.

    OBAMA:     You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:     They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:     They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
               your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;
               old.

    OBAMA:     And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get
               rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
               administrative costs and profits than they are on
               actual care. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:     They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
               your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:     And it also says that you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to get
               rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
               administrative costs and profits than they are on
               actual care.

    OBAMA:     Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
               essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
               benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
               percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
               insurance on the individual market. 
 
===================================
Event 40: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:     And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get
               rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
               administrative costs and profits than they are on
               actual care.

               benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
               &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to
               get insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:     Now, the last point I&#39;d make before| 
 
===================================
Event 41: [lines 199-201]

    LEHRER:    All right, Governor.

 ** LEHRER:    Governor, tell tell the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; directly why you
               think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?

    ROMNEY:    Well, I did with my first statement. 
 
===================================
Event 42: [lines 206-208]

    ROMNEY:    So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing
               America together and having a discussion on this
               important topic, you pushed through something that you
               and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best
               answer and drove it through.

 ** ROMNEY:    What we did in a legislature eighty seven &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;
               Democrat, we worked together; two &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt;
               legislators in my legislature, only two voted against
               the plan by the time we were finished.

    ROMNEY:    What were some differences? 
 
===================================
Event 43: [lines 209-211]

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t raise taxes.

 ** ROMNEY:    You&#39;ve raised them by &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; one trillion under
               Obamacare.

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t cut Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 44: [lines 211-213]

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t cut Medicare.

 ** ROMNEY:    Of course, we don&#39;t have Medicare, but we didn&#39;t cut
               Medicare by &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; seven &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; sixteen
               billion.

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t put in place a board that can tell people
               ultimately what treatments they&#39;re going to receive. 
 
===================================
Event 45: [lines 212-214]

    ROMNEY:    Of course, we don&#39;t have Medicare, but we didn&#39;t cut
               Medicare by dollar seven hundred sixteen billion.

 ** ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t put in place a board that can tell people
               ultimately what treatments they&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               receive.

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t also do something that I think a number of
               people across this country recognize, which is put put
               people in a position where they&#39;re going to lose the
               insurance they had and they wanted. 
 
===================================
Event 46: [lines 213-215]

    ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t put in place a board that can tell people
               ultimately what treatments they&#39;re going to receive.

 ** ROMNEY:    We didn&#39;t also do something that I think a number of
               people across this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; recognize, which is put
               put people in a position where they&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               lose the insurance they had and they wanted.

    ROMNEY:    Right now, the CBO says up to twenty million people
               will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into
               effect next year. 
 
===================================
Event 47: [lines 215-217]

    ROMNEY:    Right now, the CBO says up to twenty million people
               will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into
               effect next year.

 ** ROMNEY:    And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of
               American businesses said thirty &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; of them
               are anticipating dropping people from coverage.

    ROMNEY:    So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for
               this board, and for people losing their insurance,
               this is why the American people don&#39;t want Medicare
               don&#39;t want Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 48: [lines 216-218]

    ROMNEY:    And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of
               American businesses said thirty percent of them are

 ** ROMNEY:    So for &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; reasons, for the tax, for Medicare,
               for this board, and for people losing their insurance,
               this is why the American people don&#39;t want Medicare
               don&#39;t want Obamacare.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the
               Republicans had had the plan. 
 
===================================
Event 49: [lines 222-224]

    ROMNEY:    I think something this big, this important has to be
               done on a bipartisan basis.

 ** ROMNEY:    And we have to have a &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; who can reach
               across the aisle and fashion important legislation
               with the input from both parties.

    OBAMA:     Governor Romney said this has to be done on a
               bipartisan basis. 
 
===================================
Event 50: [lines 239-241]

    OBAMA:     Now, so what this board does is basically identifies
               best practices and says, let&#39;s use the purchasing
               power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to
               institutionalize all these good things that we do.

 ** OBAMA:     And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is
               fully implemented, we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be in a position
               to show that costs are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; down.

    OBAMA:     And over the last two years, health care premiums have
               gone up it&#39;s true but they&#39;ve gone up slower than any
               time in the last fifty years.

               have gone up it&#39;s true but they&#39;ve gone up slower than
               any time in the last fifty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     So we&#39;re already beginning to see progress. 
 
===================================
Event 52: [lines 244-246]

    OBAMA:     Let me make one last point.

 ** OBAMA:     Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I&#39;m just
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to repeal it, but but we can replace it with
               something.

    OBAMA:     But the problem is, he hasn&#39;t described what exactly
               we&#39;d replace it with, other than saying we&#39;re going to
               leave it to the states.

 ** ROMNEY:    You don&#39;t have to have the &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; mandate that
               for that to occur.

    ROMNEY:    But let&#39;s come back to something the president and I
               agree on, which is the key task we have in health care

               Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic,

 ** ROMNEY:    But the right answer is not to have the federal
               &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; take over health care and start
               mandating to the providers across America, telling a
               patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can
               have.

               that he did in Massachusetts.

 ** OBAMA:     It wasn&#39;t a &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; takeover of health care.

    OBAMA:     It was the largest expansion of private insurance.

               it with something, but can&#39;t detail how it will be in
               fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he
               did in Massachusetts was because there isn&#39;t a better
               way of dealing with the preexisting conditions
               problem.

 ** OBAMA:     It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to close deductions and loopholes for his
               tax plan.

               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be in there and you don&#39;t have to worry.

    OBAMA:     And at some point, I think the American people have to
               ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is

    OBAMA:     No.

               then, you know, these are tough problems and we&#39;ve got

    OBAMA:     Well, I definitely think there are differences. 
 
===================================
Event 84: [lines 331-333]

    LEHRER:    And do you yeah.

 ** OBAMA:     The first role of the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; is to
               keep the American people safe.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s its most basic function. 
 
===================================
Event 85: [lines 334-336]

    OBAMA:     And as commander in chief, that is something that I&#39;ve
               worked on and thought about every single day that I&#39;ve
               been in the Oval Office.

 ** OBAMA:     But I also believe that &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; has the
               capacity, the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; has the capacity
               to help open up opportunity and create ladders of
               opportunity and to create frameworks where the
               American people can succeed.

    OBAMA:     Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise
               system and freedom and the fact that people can go out
               there and start a business, work on an idea, make
               their own decisions. 
 
===================================
Event 86: [lines 337-339]

    OBAMA:     But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some
               things we do better together.

 ** OBAMA:     So, in the &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; of the Civil War, Abraham
               Lincoln said, let&#39;s help to finance the
               Transcontinental Railroad, let&#39;s start the National
               Academy of Sciences, let&#39;s start land grant colleges,
               because we want to give these gateways of opportunity
               for all Americans, because if all Americans are
               getting opportunity, we&#39;re all &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be better
               off.

    OBAMA:     That doesn&#39;t restrict people&#39;s freedom. 
 
===================================
Event 87: [lines 340-342]

    OBAMA:     That enhances it.

 ** OBAMA:     And so what I&#39;ve tried to do as &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; is to
               apply &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; same principles.

    OBAMA:     And when it comes to education what I&#39;ve said is we&#39;ve
               got to reform schools that are not working. 
 
===================================
Event 88: [lines 344-346]

    OBAMA:     Wasn&#39;t a top down approach, Governor.

 ** OBAMA:     What we&#39;ve said is to states, we&#39;ll give you more
               money if you initiate refor Miss And as a consequence,
               you had forty six states around the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; who
               have made a real difference.

    OBAMA:     But what I&#39;ve also said is let&#39;s hire another one
               hundred thousand math and science teachers to make
               sure we maintain our technological lead and our people
               are skilled and able to succeed.

               Romney doesn&#39;t think we need more teachers.

               Romney doesn&#39;t think we need more teachers.

 ** OBAMA:     I do, because I think that that is the kind of
               investment where the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; can help.

    OBAMA:     It can&#39;t do it all, but it can make a difference. 
 
===================================
Event 92: [lines 351-353]

    OBAMA:     And as a consequence we&#39;ll have a better trained
               workforce and that will create jobs because companies
               want to locate in places where we&#39;ve got a skilled
               workforce.

 ** LEHRER:    Two minutes, Governor, on the role of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER:    Your view? 
 
===================================
Event 93: [lines 358-360]

    ROMNEY:    Every school district, every state should make that
               decision on their own.

 ** ROMNEY:    The role of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;: Look behind us.

    ROMNEY:    The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. 
 
===================================
Event 94: [lines 360-362]

    ROMNEY:    The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

 ** ROMNEY:    The role of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; is to promote and protect
               the principles of &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; documents.

    ROMNEY:    First, life and liberty. 
 
===================================
Event 95: [lines 362-364]

    ROMNEY:    First, life and liberty.

 ** ROMNEY:    We have a responsibility to protect the lives and
               liberties of our people, and that means a &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;
               second to none.

    ROMNEY:    I do not believe in cutting our military. 
 
===================================
Event 96: [lines 363-365]

    ROMNEY:    We have a responsibility to protect the lives and
               liberties of our people, and that means a military
               second to none.

 ** ROMNEY:    I do not believe in cutting our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    I believe in maintaining the strength of America&#39;s
               military. 
 
===================================
Event 97: [lines 364-366]

    ROMNEY:    I do not believe in cutting our military.

 ** ROMNEY:    I believe in maintaining the strength of America&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our
               creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain
               our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in
               this country. 
 
===================================
Event 98: [lines 365-367]

    ROMNEY:    I believe in maintaining the strength of America&#39;s
               military.

 ** ROMNEY:    Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our
               creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain
               our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in
               this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    That statement also says that we are endowed by our
               creator with the right to pursue happiness as we
               choose. 
 
===================================
Event 99: [lines 367-369]

    ROMNEY:    That statement also says that we are endowed by our
               creator with the right to pursue happiness as we
               choose.

 ** ROMNEY:    I interpret that as, one, making sure that &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt;
               people who are less fortunate and can&#39;t care for
               themselves are cared by by one another.

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;re a nation that believes that we&#39;re all children
               of the same god and we care for those that have
               difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems
               and challenges, those that are disabled. 
 
===================================
Event 100: [lines 368-370]

    ROMNEY:    I interpret that as, one, making sure that those
               people who are less fortunate and can&#39;t care for
               themselves are cared by by one another.

               difficulties, &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that are elderly and have
               problems and challenges, &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that are disabled.

    ROMNEY:    We care for them. 
 
===================================
Event 101: [lines 371-373]

    ROMNEY:    And we we look for discovery and innovation, all these
               things desired out of the American heart to provide
               the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.

 ** ROMNEY:    But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the
               right to pursue their dreams and not to have the
               &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; substitute itself for the rights of
               free individuals.

    ROMNEY:    And what we&#39;re seeing right now is, in my view, a a
               trickle down government approach, which has government
               thinking it can do a better job than free people
               pursuing their drea Miss And it&#39;s not working. 
 
===================================
Event 102: [lines 372-374]

    ROMNEY:    But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the
               right to pursue their dreams and not to have the
               government substitute itself for the rights of free
               individuals.

               free people pursuing their drea Miss And it&#39;s not
               working.

    ROMNEY:    And the proof of that is twenty three million people
               out of work. 
 
===================================
Event 103: [lines 376-378]

    ROMNEY:    The proof of that is we&#39;ve gone from thirty two
               million on food stamps to forty seven million on food
               stamps.

 ** ROMNEY:    The proof of that is that fifty &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; of college
               graduates this year can&#39;t find work.

    LEHRER:    All right. 
 
===================================
Event 104: [lines 381-383]

    LEHRER:    All right.

 ** LEHRER:    Let&#39;s go through some specifics in terms of what how
               each of you views the role of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER:    How do education. 
 
===================================
Event 105: [lines 383-385]

    LEHRER:    How do education.

 ** LEHRER:    Does the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; have a responsibility
               to improve the quality of public education in America?

    ROMNEY:    Well, the primary responsibility for education is is,
               of course, at the state and local level. 
 
===================================
Event 106: [lines 385-387]

    ROMNEY:    Well, the primary responsibility for education is is,
               of course, at the state and local level.

 ** ROMNEY:    But the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; also can play a very
               important role.

    ROMNEY:    And I and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he&#39;s
               some ideas he&#39;s put forward on Race to the Top, not
               all of them, but some of them I agree with and and
               congratulate him for pursuing that. 
 
===================================
Event 107: [lines 387-389]

    ROMNEY:    And I and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he&#39;s
               some ideas he&#39;s put forward on Race to the Top, not
               all of them, but some of them I agree with and and
               congratulate him for pursuing that.

 ** ROMNEY:    The federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; can get local and and state
               schools to do a better job.

    ROMNEY:    My own view, by the way, is I&#39;ve added to that. 
 
===================================
Event 108: [lines 390-392]

    ROMNEY:    I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting
               federal dollars from IDEA or Title I these are
               disabled kids or or or poor kids or or lower income
               kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the
               school of their choice.

 ** ROMNEY:    So all federal funds, instead of &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to the to
               the state or to the school district, I&#39;d have go, if
               you will, follow the child and let the parent and the
               child decide where to send their their their student.

    LEHRER:    How do you see the federal government&#39;s responsibility
               to, as I say, to improve the quality of public
               education in this country? 
 
===================================
Event 109: [lines 391-393]

    ROMNEY:    So all federal funds, instead of going to the to the
               state or to the school district, I&#39;d have go, if you
               will, follow the child and let the parent and the
               child decide where to send their their their student.

 ** LEHRER:    How do you see the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;&#39;s
               responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of
               public education in this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;?

    OBAMA:     Well, as I&#39;ve indicated, I think that it has a
               significant role to play. 
 
===================================
Event 110: [lines 394-396]

    OBAMA:     Through our Race to the Top program, we&#39;ve worked with
               Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major
               reforms, and they&#39;re having an impact right now.

 ** LEHRER:    Do you think you have a difference with your views and
               and &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; of Governor Romney on about education
               and the federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;?

    OBAMA:     You know, this is where budgets matter, because
               budgets reflect choices. 
 
===================================
Event 111: [lines 400-402]

    OBAMA:     This seems to be a trend.

 ** OBAMA:     But but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how
               much money we&#39;re talking about, you&#39;d look at cutting
               the education budget by up to twenty &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing
               great work done out there all over the country because
               we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that
               exist right now. 
 
===================================
Event 112: [lines 401-403]

    OBAMA:     But but what it did do is to if you extrapolated how
               much money we&#39;re talking about, you&#39;d look at cutting
               the education budget by up to twenty percent.

 ** OBAMA:     When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing

               because we have the opportunity to train people for
               jobs that exist right now.

    OBAMA:     And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I
               probably agree on is getting businesses to work with
               community colleges so that they&#39;re setting up their
               training progra Miss | 
 
===================================
Event 113: [lines 405-407]

    OBAMA:     Let me just finish the point.

 ** OBAMA:     The where they&#39;re partnering so that they&#39;re designing
               training progra Miss And people who are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               through them know that there&#39;s a job waiting for them
               if they complete it.

    OBAMA:     That makes a big difference, but that requires some
               federal support. 
 
===================================
Event 114: [lines 408-410]

    OBAMA:     Let me just say one final example.

 ** OBAMA:     When it comes to making college affordable, whether
               it&#39;s two year or four year, one of the things that I
               did as &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; was we were sending &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt;
               sixty billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for
               the student loan program, even though the loans were
               guaranteed.

    OBAMA:     So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but
               they were taking billions out of the system. 
 
===================================
Event 115: [lines 414-416]

    OBAMA:     Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about
               education, but when he tells a student that, you know,
               you should borrow money from your parents to go to
               college, you know, that indicates the degree to which,
               you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the
               fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids
               probably who attend University of Denver, just don&#39;t
               have that option.

 ** OBAMA:     And for us to be able to make sure that they&#39;ve got
               that opportunity and they can walk through that door,
               that is vitally important not just to &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; kids.

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s how we&#39;re going to grow this economy over the
               long term. 
 
===================================
Event 116: [lines 415-417]

===================================
Event 120: [lines 423-425]

    ROMNEY:    But you make a very good point, which is that the
               place you put your money just makes a pretty clear
               indication of where your heart is.

 ** ROMNEY:    You put &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; ninety billion into into green
               jobs.

               been invested in have gone out of business.

    ROMNEY:    A number of them happened to be owned by people who
               were contributors to your campaigns.

 ** ROMNEY:    Look, the right course for America&#39;s &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;,
               we were talking about the role of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;, is
               not to become the economic player, picking winners and
               losers, telling people what kind of health treatment
               they can receive, taking over the health care system

               time and has produced the best health records in the
               world.

    ROMNEY:    The right answer for government is say, How do we make
               the private sector become more efficient and more
               effective?

 ** LEHRER:    Many of the legislative functions of the federal
               &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; right now are in a state of paralysis
               as a result of partisan gridlock.

    LEHRER:    If elected, in your case, if re elected, in your case,
               what would you do about that? 
 
===================================
Event 130: [lines 455-457]

    LEHRER:    Governor?

 ** ROMNEY:    Jim, I had the great experience it didn&#39;t seem like it
               at the time of being elected in a state where my
               legislature was eighty seven &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; Democrat.

    ROMNEY:    And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get
               along and I had to work across the aisle to get
               anything done. 
 
===================================
Event 131: [lines 459-461]

    ROMNEY:    We cut taxes nineteen times.

 ** LEHRER:    But what would you do as &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;?

    ROMNEY:    We as president, I will sit on day one actually, the
               day after I get elected I&#39;ll sit down with leaders the
               Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and
               continue as we did in my state we met every Monday for
               a couple hours, talked about the issues and the
               challenges in the in the in our state in that case.

               challenges in the in the in our state in that case.

    ROMNEY:    We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because
               we&#39;re going to compromise our principle, but because
               there&#39;s common ground.

    ROMNEY:    And the challenges America faces right now look, the
               reason I&#39;m in this race is there are people that are
               really hurting today in this country.

    LEHRER:    Mister President?

 ** OBAMA:     Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have a busy first day, because he&#39;s also
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very
               popular among Democrats as you&#39;re sitting down with
               them.

    OBAMA:     But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas
               from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as
               they&#39;re advancing the cause of making middle class
               families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to
               the middle class. 
 
===================================

               the &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we cut taxes for middle class families and
               small businesses. 
 
===================================
Event 137: [lines 473-475]

    OBAMA:     But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we cut taxes for &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class families
               and small businesses.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that
               wasn&#39;t advancing that cause. 
 
===================================
Event 138: [lines 477-479]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we repealed don&#39;t ask/don&#39;t tell.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised,
               and that&#39;s how we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to wind down the war in
               Afghanistan.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. 
 
===================================
Event 139: [lines 484-486]

    OBAMA:     Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be
               had.

 ** OBAMA:     When when we were fighting about whether or not we
               were &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to make sure that Americans had more
               security with their health insurance and they said no,
               yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.

    LEHRER:    NA 
 
===================================
Event 140: [lines 493-495]

    OBAMA:     And I want to thank the University of Denver.

 ** OBAMA:     You know, four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, we were &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               through a major crisis.

    OBAMA:     And yet my faith and confidence in the American future
               is undiminished. 
 
===================================
Event 141: [lines 497-499]

    OBAMA:     The auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit
               take such pride in building the best cars in the
               world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it
               gives them that sense of pride, that they&#39;re helping
               to build America.

 ** OBAMA:     And so the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; now is how do we build on
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; strengths.

    OBAMA:     And everything that I&#39;ve tried to do, and everything
               that I&#39;m now proposing for the next four years in
               terms of improving our education system or developing
               American energy or making sure that we&#39;re closing
               loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs
               overseas and focusing on small businesses and
               companies that are creating jobs here in the United
               States, or closing our deficit in a responsible,
               balanced way that allows us to invest in our future. 
 
===================================
Event 142: [lines 498-500]

    OBAMA:     And so the question now is how do we build on those
               strengths.

               States, or closing our deficit in a responsible,
               balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.

    OBAMA:     All those things are designed to make sure that the
               American people, their genius, their grit, their
               determination, is is channeled and and they have an

    OBAMA:     And everybody&#39;s getting a fair shot. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     And everybody&#39;s getting a fair share everybody&#39;s doing
               a fair share, and everybody&#39;s playing by the same
               rules.

 ** OBAMA:     You know, four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, I said that I&#39;m not a
               perfect man and I wouldn&#39;t be a perfect &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s probably a promise that Governor Romney
               thinks I&#39;ve kept. 
 
===================================
Event 145: [lines 504-506]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s probably a promise that Governor Romney
               thinks I&#39;ve kept.

 ** OBAMA:     But I also promised that I&#39;d fight every single day on
               behalf of the American people, the &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class,
               and all &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who were striving to get into the
               &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class.

    OBAMA:     I&#39;ve kept that promise and if you&#39;ll vote for me, then
               I promise I&#39;ll fight just as hard in a second term. 
 
===================================
Event 146: [lines 510-512]

    ROMNEY:    This is a this is an important election and I&#39;m
               concerned about America.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m concerned about the direction America has been
               taking over the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    I I know this is bigger than an election about the two
               of us as individuals. 
 
===================================
Event 147: [lines 515-517]

    ROMNEY:    What kind of America do you want to have for yourself
               and for your children.

 ** ROMNEY:    And there really are two very different paths that we
               began speaking about this evening, and over the course
               of this month we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have two more
               presidential debates and a vice presidential debate.

    ROMNEY:    But they lead in very different directions. 
 
===================================
Event 149: [lines 520-522]

    ROMNEY:    You can look at the record.

 ** ROMNEY:    There&#39;s no &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; in my mind that if the
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; were to be reelected you&#39;ll continue to
               see a &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class squeeze with incomes &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               down and prices &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; up.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ll get incomes up again. 
 
===================================
Event 150: [lines 523-525]

    ROMNEY:    You&#39;ll see chronic unemployment.

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;ve had forty three straight months with
               unemployment above eight &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    If I&#39;m president I will create help create twelve
               million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.

 ** ROMNEY:    If the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s reelected, Obamacare will be
               fully installed.

    ROMNEY:    In my view that&#39;s going to mean a whole different way
               of life for people who counted on the insurance plan
               they had in the past.

    ROMNEY:    Many will lose it.

 ** ROMNEY:    You&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to see health premiums go up by some

               family.

    ROMNEY:    If I&#39;m elected we won&#39;t have Obama. 
 
===================================
Event 155: [lines 531-533]

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;ll put in place the kind of principles that I put
               in place in my own state and allow each state to craft
               their own programs to get people insured and we&#39;ll
               focus on getting the cost of health care down.

 ** ROMNEY:    If the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; were to be reelected you&#39;re

               sixteen billion cut to Medicare.

               Advantage. 
 
===================================
Event 156: [lines 534-536]

    ROMNEY:    You&#39;ll have hospital and providers that&#39;ll no longer
               accept Medicare patients.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;ll restore that &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; seven &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; sixteen

               being asked by college kids all over this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just
               graduated this was in Philadelphia and she said, I&#39;ve
               got my degree. 
 
===================================
Event 166: [lines 578-580]

    ROMNEY:    And also make sure that when they get out of college,
               there&#39;s a job.

 ** ROMNEY:    When I was &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; of Massachusetts, to get a
               high school degree, you had to pass an exam.

    ROMNEY:    If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines,
               we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four
               years tuition free in the college of your choice in
               Massachusetts, it&#39;s a public institution.

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;re also &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have our loan program, so that
               people are able to afford school.

    ROMNEY:    But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job
               when you get out of school.

               a college excuse me, without a job. 
 
===================================
Event 171: [lines 590-592]

    ROMNEY:    So more debt and less jobs.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to change that.

===================================
Event 172: [lines 593-595]

    ROMNEY:    I know what it takes to make sure that you have the

 ** ROMNEY:    The &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class has been crushed over the last
               four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;, and jobs have been too scarce.

    ROMNEY:    I know what it takes to bring them back, and I&#39;m going
               to do that, and make sure that when you graduate when
               do you graduate?

Event 180: [lines 607-609]

    OBAMA:     Not just to you, but to the entire nation.

 ** OBAMA:     Now, the most important thing we can do is to make
               sure that we are creating jobs in this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; again.

    OBAMA:     Now when Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go

               the American auto industry and it&#39;s come surging back.

    OBAMA:     I want to do that in industries, not just in Detroit,
               but all across the country and that means we change
               our tax code so we&#39;re giving incentives to companies
               that are investing here in the United States and
               creating jobs here.

               companies that are investing here in the United States
               and creating jobs here.

    OBAMA:     It also means we&#39;re helping them and small businesses
               to export all around the world to new markets. 
 
===================================
Event 184: [lines 618-620]

    OBAMA:     Number two, we&#39;ve got to make sure that we have the
               best education system in the world.

 ** OBAMA:     And the fact that you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to college is
               great, but I want everybody to get a great education
               and we&#39;ve worked hard to make sure that student loans
               are available for folks like you, but I also want to
               make sure that community colleges are offering slots
               for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out
               there right now and the jobs of the future.

    OBAMA:     Number three, we&#39;ve got to control our own energy.

 ** OBAMA:     Number three, we&#39;ve got to control our own &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we&#39;ve been
               investing in; but also, we&#39;ve got to make sure we&#39;re
               building the energy source of the future, not just
               thinking about next year, but ten years from now,
               twenty years from now. 
 
===================================

               twenty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; from now.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we&#39;ve invested in solar and wind and
               biofuels, energy efficient cars. 
 
===================================
Event 187: [lines 621-623]

    OBAMA:     Now, not only oil and natural gas, which we&#39;ve been

               biofuels, &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; efficient cars.

    OBAMA:     We&#39;ve got to reduce our deficit, but we&#39;ve got to do
               it in a balanced way. 
 
===================================
Event 188: [lines 625-627]

    OBAMA:     And let&#39;s take the money that we&#39;ve been spending on
               war over the last decade to rebuild America, roads,
               bridges schools.

 ** OBAMA:     We do &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; things, not only is your future
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be bright but America&#39;s future is
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to bright as well.

               with Mister Romney just quickly what what can you do?

Event 189: [lines 627-629]

    CROWLEY:   Let me ask you for more immediate answer and begin
               with Mister Romney just quickly what what can you do?

               of the unemployed have been unemployed have been
               unemployed for six months or more.

    CROWLEY:   They don&#39;t have the two years that Jeremy has.

               the unemployed have been unemployed have been
               unemployed for six months or more.

 ** CROWLEY:   They don&#39;t have the two &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; that Jeremy has.

    CROWLEY:   What about those long term unemployed who need a job
               right now? 
 
===================================
Event 191: [lines 629-631]

    CROWLEY:   They don&#39;t have the two years that Jeremy has.

 ** CROWLEY:   What about &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; long term unemployed who need a
               job right now?

    ROMNEY:    Well what you&#39;re seeing in this country is twenty
               three million people struggling to find a job.

               right now?

 ** ROMNEY:    Well what you&#39;re seeing in this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; is twenty
               three million people struggling to find a job.

    ROMNEY:    And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of
               work for a long, long, long time. 
 
===================================
Event 193: [lines 632-634]

    ROMNEY:    And a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of
               work for a long, long, long time.

 ** ROMNEY:    The &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s policies have been exercised over
               the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; and they haven&#39;t put Americans
               back to work.

    ROMNEY:    We have fewer people working today than we had when
               the president took office. 
 
===================================
Event 194: [lines 633-635]

    ROMNEY:    The president&#39;s policies have been exercised over the
               last four years and they haven&#39;t put Americans back to
               work.

 ** ROMNEY:    We have fewer people working today than we had when
               the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; took office.

    ROMNEY:    If the the unemployment rate was seven. 
 
===================================
Event 195: [lines 635-637]

    ROMNEY:    If the the unemployment rate was seven.

 ** ROMNEY:    eight &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; when he took office, it&#39;s seven.

    ROMNEY:    eight percent now. 
 
===================================
Event 196: [lines 636-638]

    ROMNEY:    eight percent when he took office, it&#39;s seven.

 ** ROMNEY:    eight &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; now.

    ROMNEY:    But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking
               back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it
               would be ten. 
 
===================================
Event 197: [lines 638-640]

    ROMNEY:    But if you calculated that unemployment rate, taking
               back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it
               would be ten.

 ** ROMNEY:    seven &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    We have not made the progress we need to make to put
               people back to work. 
 
===================================
Event 198: [lines 640-642]

    ROMNEY:    We have not made the progress we need to make to put
               people back to work.

 ** ROMNEY:    That&#39;s why I put out a five point plan that gets
               America twelve million new jobs in four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; and
               rising take home pay.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out
               of school. 
 
===================================
Event 199: [lines 641-643]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s why I put out a five point plan that gets
               America twelve million new jobs in four years and
               rising take home pay.

 ** ROMNEY:    It&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to help Jeremy get a job when he comes
               out of school.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s going to help people across the country that are
               unemployed right now. 
 
===================================
Event 200: [lines 642-644]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out

 ** ROMNEY:    It&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to help people across the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;
               that are unemployed right now.

    ROMNEY:    And one thing that the president said, which I want to
               make sure that we understand, he said that I said we
               should take Detroit bankrupt. 
 
===================================
Event 201: [lines 643-645]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s going to help people across the country that are
               unemployed right now.

 ** ROMNEY:    And one thing that the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; said, which I
               want to make sure that we understand, he said that I
               said we should take Detroit bankrupt.

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s right. 
 
===================================
Event 202: [lines 647-649]

    ROMNEY:    And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit
               bankrupt.

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; took Detroit bankrupt.

    ROMNEY:    You took General Motors bankrupt. 
 
===================================
Event 203: [lines 651-653]

    ROMNEY:    So when you say that I wanted to take the auto
               industry bankrupt, you actually did.

 ** ROMNEY:    And I think it&#39;s important to know that that was a
               process that was necessary to get &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; companies
               back on their feet, so they could start hiring more
               people.

    ROMNEY:    That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately
               what happened. 
 
===================================
Event 204: [lines 653-655]

    ROMNEY:    That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately
               what happened.

 ** CROWLEY:   Let me give the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; a chance.

    CROWLEY:   Go ahead. 
 
===================================
Event 205: [lines 659-661]

    OBAMA:     And that don&#39;t take my word for it, take the
               executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are
               Republicans, may even support Governor Romney.

 ** OBAMA:     But they&#39;ll tell you his prescription wasn&#39;t &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               to work.

    OBAMA:     And Governor Romney&#39;s says he&#39;s got a five point plan? 
 
===================================
Event 206: [lines 664-666]

    OBAMA:     And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top
               play by a different set of rules.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s been his philosophy in the private sector,
               that&#39;s been his philosophy as &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt;, that&#39;s
               been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.

    OBAMA:     You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates
               than somebody who makes a lot less. 
 
===================================
Event 207: [lines 669-671]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s exactly the philosophy that we&#39;ve seen in place
               for the last decade.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s what&#39;s been squeezing &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class
               families.

    OBAMA:     And we have fought back for four years to get out of
               that mess.

 ** OBAMA:     And we have fought back for four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; to get out
               of that mess.

    CROWLEY:   Because I want to move you on to something that&#39;s sort
               of connected to cars here, and and go over.

 ** CROWLEY:   And we want to get a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; from Phillip

 ** OBAMA:     The most important thing we can do is to make sure we
               control our own &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     So here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done since I&#39;ve been president.

 ** OBAMA:     So here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done since I&#39;ve been
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     So here&#39;s what I&#39;ve done since I&#39;ve been president.

 ** OBAMA:     We have increased oil production to the highest levels
               in sixteen &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Natural gas production is the highest it&#39;s been in
               decades. 
 
===================================
Event 215: [lines 690-692]

    OBAMA:     We have seen increases in coal production and coal
               employment.

 ** OBAMA:     But what I&#39;ve also said is we can&#39;t just produce
               traditional source of &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     We&#39;ve also got to look to the future. 
 
===================================
Event 216: [lines 693-695]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on
               cars.

 ** OBAMA:     That means that in the &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; of the next decade,
               any car you buy, you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to end up &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               twice as far on a gallon of gas.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we doubled clean clean energy production
               like wind and solar and biofuels. 
 
===================================
Event 217: [lines 694-696]

    OBAMA:     That means that in the middle of the next decade, any

               on a gallon of gas.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we doubled clean clean &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;
               production like wind and solar and biofuels.

    OBAMA:     And all these things have contributed to us lowering
               our oil imports to the lowest levels in sixteen years.

Event 219: [lines 699-701]

    OBAMA:     We continue to make it a priority for us to go after
               natural gas.

 ** OBAMA:     We&#39;ve got potentially six &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt;
               jobs and one &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; worth of &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;

===================================
Event 220: [lines 701-703]

    OBAMA:     And we can do it in an environmentally sound way.

 ** OBAMA:     But we&#39;ve also got to continue to figure out how we
               have efficiency &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;, because ultimately that&#39;s
               how we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to reduce demand and that&#39;s what&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to keep gas prices lower.

    OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney will say he&#39;s got an all of the
               above plan, but basically his plan is to let the oil
               companies write the energy policies.

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, let&#39;s look at the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s policies, all
               right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we&#39;ve had
               four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; of policies being played out.

    ROMNEY:    And the president&#39;s right in terms of the additional
               oil production, but none of it came on federal land. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    As a matter of fact, oil production is down fourteen
               percent this year on federal land, and gas production
               was down nine percent.

    ROMNEY:    Why? 
 
===================================
Event 231: [lines 715-717]

    ROMNEY:    Why?

 ** ROMNEY:    Because the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; cut in half the number of
               licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands,
               and in federal waters.

    ROMNEY:    So where&#39;d the increase come from? 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal,
               our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.

 ** ROMNEY:    I believe very much in our renewable capabilities;
               ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our
               &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; mix.

               build a coal plant, you can go ahead, but you&#39;ll go
               bankrupt.

               have, as well as the &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; ources for the future.

               doing, which is getting us energy independent, North
               America energy independence within eight years, you&#39;re

               guy, I mean, keep in mind, when Governor, when you
               were &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; of Massachusetts, you stood in front
               of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant
               kills, and took great pride in shutting it down.

    OBAMA:     And now suddenly you&#39;re a big champion of coal. 
 
===================================
Event 250: [lines 756-758]

    OBAMA:     Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas.

 ** OBAMA:     And the proof is our oil imports are down to the
               lowest levels in twenty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Oil production is up, natural gas production is up,
               and, most importantly, we&#39;re also starting to build
               cars that are more efficient. 
 
===================================
Event 251: [lines 759-761]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s creating jobs.

 ** OBAMA:     That means &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; cars can be exported, &#39;cause
               that&#39;s the demand around the world, and it also means
               that it&#39;ll save money in your pocketbook.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s the strategy you need, an all of the above
               strategy, and that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to do in the
               next four years.

===================================
Event 254: [lines 763-765]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s the problem.

 ** ROMNEY:    In the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;, you cut permits and
               licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.

    OBAMA:     Not true, Governor Romney. 
 
===================================
Event 255: [lines 773-775]

    OBAMA:     There were a whole bunch of oil companies.

 ** ROMNEY:    No, no, I had a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; and the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; was
               how much did you cut them by?

    OBAMA:     You want me to answer a question? 
 
===================================
Event 256: [lines 774-776]

    ROMNEY:    No, no, I had a question and the question was how much
               did you cut them by?

 ** OBAMA:     You want me to answer a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;?

    ROMNEY:    All right. 
 
===================================
Event 258: [lines 781-783]

    OBAMA:     You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases
               on public lands that they weren&#39;t using.

 ** OBAMA:     So what we said was you can&#39;t just sit on this for
               ten, twenty, thirty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;, decide when you want to
               drill, when you want to produce, when it&#39;s most
               profitable for you.

    OBAMA:     These are public lands. 
 
===================================
Event 259: [lines 785-787]

    ROMNEY:    OK, |

 ** OBAMA:     And so what we did was take away &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; leases.

    OBAMA:     And we are now reletting them so that we can actually
               make a profit. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     And we are now reletting them so that we can actually
               make a profit.

    OBAMA:     Production is up. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     No, it isn&#39;t.

 ** ROMNEY:    Production on &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; land of oil is down
               fourteen &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Governor. 
 
===================================
Event 262: [lines 796-798]

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s absolutely true.

 ** ROMNEY:    Look, there&#39;s no &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; but the people recognize
               that we have not produced more on federal lands and in
               federal waters.

    ROMNEY:    And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not
               up. 
 
===================================
Event 263: [lines 798-800]

    ROMNEY:    And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not
               up.

 ** ROMNEY:    I was just at a coal facility, where some one
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; two &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; people lost their jobs.

    ROMNEY:    The right course for America is to have a true all of
               the above policy.

    ROMNEY:    The right course for America is to have a true all of
               the above policy.

               person who&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be pushing for oil and gas
               and coal.

    ROMNEY:    You&#39;ll get your chance in a moment. 
 
===================================
Event 265: [lines 806-808]

    OBAMA:     .

 ** ROMNEY:    That wasn&#39;t the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     OK. 
 
===================================
Event 266: [lines 814-816]

    ROMNEY:    But you&#39;re paying more.

 ** ROMNEY:    When the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; took office, the price of
               gasoline here in Nassau County was about &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt;
               one.

    ROMNEY:    eighty six a gallon. 
 
===================================
Event 267: [lines 816-818]

    ROMNEY:    eighty six a gallon.

 ** ROMNEY:    Now, it&#39;s &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; four.

    ROMNEY:    a gallon. 
 
===================================
Event 268: [lines 819-821]

    ROMNEY:    The price of electricity is up.

 ** ROMNEY:    If the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; policies are
               working, you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to see the cost of
               &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; come down.

    ROMNEY:    I will fight to create more energy in this country, to
               get America energy secure. 
 
===================================
Event 269: [lines 820-822]

    ROMNEY:    If the president&#39;s energy policies are working, you&#39;re
               going to see the cost of energy come down.

 ** ROMNEY:    I will fight to create more &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; in this
               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;, to get America &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; secure.

    ROMNEY:    And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from
               Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have
               here, drilling offshore in Alaska, drilling offshore
               in Virginia where the people want it.

 ** ROMNEY:    Those things will get us the &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; we need.

    CROWLEY:   Mister President, could you address, because we did
               finally get to gas prices here, could you address what
               the governor said, which is if your energy policy was
               working, the price of gasoline would not be dollar
               four a gallon here. 
 
===================================

    CROWLEY:   Is that true? 
 
===================================
Event 272: [lines 825-827]

    CROWLEY:   Is that true?

 ** OBAMA:     Well, think about what the &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; think about
               what the &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; just said.

    OBAMA:     He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was
               dollar one. 
 
===================================
Event 273: [lines 826-828]

    OBAMA:     Well, think about what the governor think about what
               the governor just said.

 ** OBAMA:     He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was
               &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; one.

    OBAMA:     eighty, dollar one. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was
               dollar one.

 ** OBAMA:     eighty, &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; one.

    OBAMA:     eighty six. 
 
===================================
Event 275: [lines 830-832]

    OBAMA:     Why is that?

 ** OBAMA:     Because the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; was on the verge of collapse,
               because we were about to go through the worst
               recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence
               of some of the same policies that Governor Romney&#39;s
               now promoting.

    OBAMA:     So, it&#39;s conceivable that Governor Romney could bring
               down gas prices because with his policies, we might be
               back in that same mess. 
 
===================================

               down gas prices because with his policies, we might be
               back in that same mess.

 ** OBAMA:     What I want to do is to create an &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; that is
               strong, and at the same time produce &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney
               keeps on talking about, we&#39;ve we&#39;ve built enough
               pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once. 
 
===================================
Event 277: [lines 837-839]

    OBAMA:     What I&#39;m not for is us ignoring the other half of the
               equation.

 ** OBAMA:     So, for example, on wind &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;, when Governor
               Romney says these are imaginary jobs.

    OBAMA:     When you&#39;ve got thousands of people right now in Iowa,
               right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind
               power with good paying manufacturing jobs, and the
               Republican senator in that in Iowa is all for it,
               providing tax breaks to help this work and Governor
               Romney says I&#39;m opposed. 
 
===================================
Event 278: [lines 840-842]

    OBAMA:     I&#39;d get rid of it.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s not an &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; strategy for the future.

               work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in
               order to make up for the loss in revenue.

    QUESTION:  Concerning the these various deductions, the mortgage
               deductions, the charitable deductions, the child tax
               credit and also the oh, what&#39;s that other credit?

 ** ROMNEY:    &#39;Cause I&#39;m &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to bring rates down across the

               for people at the high end, because I am not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               to have people at the high end pay less than they&#39;re
               paying now.

    ROMNEY:    And so, in terms of bringing down deductions, one way
               of doing that would be say everybody gets I&#39;ll pick a

    ROMNEY:    But your rate comes down and the burden also comes
               down on you for one more reason, and that is every

               &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class families, and for small business.

    OBAMA:     But what I&#39;ve also said is, if we&#39;re serious about
               reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral
               obligation to the next generation, then in addition to
               some tough spending cuts, we&#39;ve also got to make sure
               that the wealthy do a little bit more.

               families, ninety seven &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; of small
               businesses, they will not see a tax increase.

    OBAMA:     I&#39;m ready to sign that bill right now. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     I&#39;m ready to sign that bill right now.

 ** OBAMA:     The only reason it&#39;s not happening is because Governor
               Romney&#39;s allies in Congress have held the ninety eight
               &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; hostage because they want tax breaks for
               the top two &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     But what I&#39;ve also says is for above dollar two
               hundred fifty thousand, we can go back to the tax
               rates we had when Bill Clinton was president.

    OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.

 ** OBAMA:     He was on sixty Minutes just two weeks ago and he was
               asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making
               &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; twenty million a year, to pay a lower tax
               rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making
               &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; fifty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; year?

               have found about it earlier, whereas she had no way of
               finding out about it.

    OBAMA:     So we fixed that. 
 
===================================
Event 379: [lines 1051-1053]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s an example of the kind of advocacy that we
               need, because women are increasingly the breadwinners
               in the family.

 ** OBAMA:     This is not just a women&#39;s issue, this is a family
               issue, this is a &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class issue, and that&#39;s
               why we&#39;ve got to fight for it.

    OBAMA:     It also means that we&#39;ve got to make sure that young
               people like yourself are able to afford a college
               education.

    OBAMA:     Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that&#39;s
               exactly what we&#39;ve done.

               including millions of young women, all across the
               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     We did it by taking dollar sixty billion that was
               going to banks and lenders as middlemen for the
               student loan program, and we said, let&#39;s just cut out

               to make sure that young women are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be able
               to compete in that marketplace.

    OBAMA:     But we&#39;ve got to enforce the laws, which is what we
               are doing, and we&#39;ve also got to make sure that in
               every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination.

               deal about, particularly as I was serving as

               pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed
               to be men.

               the people for these jobs are are all men.

               women to be part of that team was because of our

 ** ROMNEY:    But number two, because I recognized that if you&#39;re
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have women in the workforce that
               sometimes you need to be more flexible.

    OBAMA:     Well, first of all, I think it&#39;s important to tell you
               that we did come in during some tough times.

 ** OBAMA:     We were losing eight &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; jobs a
               month when I started.

    OBAMA:     But we had been digging our way out of policies that
               were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well
               and middle class folks not doing well.

               and &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class folks not doing well.

    OBAMA:     Now, we&#39;ve seen thirty consecutive thirty one
               consecutive months of job growth; five. 
 
===================================
Event 420: [lines 1179-1181]

    OBAMA:     When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in
               mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that
               were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is
               currently investing in countries in companies that are
               building surveillance equipment for China to spy on
               its own folks.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s Governor, you&#39;re the last person who&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to get tough on China.

    OBAMA:     And what we&#39;ve done when it comes to trade is not only
               sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but
               we&#39;ve also set up a task force for trade that goes
               after anybody who is taking advantage of American
               workers or businesses and not creating a level playing
               field. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     When I said that we had to make sure that China was
               not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires,
               Governor Romney said I was being protectionist; that
               it wouldn&#39;t be helpful to American workers.

 ** OBAMA:     Well, in fact we saved one &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; jobs.

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s the kind of tough trade actions that are
               required.

               after Al Qaeda&#39;s leadership like never before and
               Osama bin Laden is dead.

               since the one &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; nine &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; thirtys.

 ** ROMNEY:    eight &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;, between that period the end of that
               recession and the equivalent of time to today, Ronald
               Reagan&#39;s recovery created twice as many jobs as this
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s recovery.

    ROMNEY:    Five million jobs doesn&#39;t even keep up with our
               population growth. 
 
===================================
Event 461: [lines 1283-1285]

    ROMNEY:    And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a
               little lower today is because of all the people that
               have dropped out of the workforce.

 ** ROMNEY:    The &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; has tried, but his policies haven&#39;t
               worked.

    ROMNEY:    He&#39;s great as a as a as a speaker and describing his
               plans and his vision. 
 
===================================
Event 462: [lines 1287-1289]

    ROMNEY:    And that record shows he just hasn&#39;t been able to cut
               the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and
               Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising
               incomes we need.

 ** ROMNEY:    Median income is down &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; four &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt;
               three &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; a family and twenty three million
               Americans out of work.

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s what this election is about. 
 
===================================
Event 463: [lines 1289-1291]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s what this election is about.

 ** ROMNEY:    It&#39;s about who can get the &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt; class in this
               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; a bright and prosperous future and assure
               our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.

    CROWLEY:   Governor, I want to move you along. 
 
===================================
Event 464: [lines 1295-1297]

    CROWLEY:   Mister President, I&#39;ll be right back with you.

 ** CROWLEY:   Lorraine Osorio has a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; for you about a
               topic we have not|

    OBAMA:     This is for Governor Romney? 
 
===================================
Event 465: [lines 1311-1313]

    ROMNEY:    Good.

 ** ROMNEY:    Thank you for your &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    And let me step back and tell you what I would like to
               do with our immigration policy broadly and include an
               answer to your question. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    Thank you for your question.

 ** ROMNEY:    And let me step back and tell you what I would like to
               do with our immigration policy broadly and include an
               answer to your &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants. 
 
===================================
Event 467: [lines 1314-1316]

    ROMNEY:    But first of all, this is a nation of immigrants.

 ** ROMNEY:    We welcome people coming to this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; as
               immigrants.

    ROMNEY:    My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann&#39;s
               dad was born in Wales and is a first generation
               American.

               dad was born in Wales and is a first generation
               American.

 ** ROMNEY:    We welcome legal immigrants into this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    I want our legal system to work better. 
 
===================================
Event 469: [lines 1320-1322]

    ROMNEY:    I want it to be clearer.

 ** ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t think you have to shouldn&#39;t have to hire a
               lawyer to figure out how to get into this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;
               legally.

    ROMNEY:    I also think that we should give visas to people green
               cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that
               we need. 
 
===================================
Event 470: [lines 1326-1328]

    ROMNEY:    We should make sure our legal system works.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to stop illegal
               immigration.

    ROMNEY:    There are four million people who are waiting in line
               to get here legally. 
 
===================================
Event 471: [lines 1329-1331]

    ROMNEY:    Those who&#39;ve come here illegally take their place.

 ** ROMNEY:    So I will not grant amnesty to &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who have come
               here illegally.

    ROMNEY:    What I will do is I&#39;ll put in place an employment
               verification system and make sure that employers that
               hire people who have come here illegally are
               sanctioned for doing so. 
 
===================================
Event 472: [lines 1332-1334]

    ROMNEY:    I won&#39;t put in place magnets for people coming here
               illegally.

 ** ROMNEY:    So for instance, I would not give driver&#39;s licenses to
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that have come here illegally as the
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; would.

    ROMNEY:    The kids of those that came here illegally, those
               kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a
               permanent resident of the United States and military
               service, for instance, is one way they would have that
               kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. 
 
===================================
Event 473: [lines 1333-1335]

    ROMNEY:    So for instance, I would not give driver&#39;s licenses to
               those that have come here illegally as the president
               would.

 ** ROMNEY:    The kids of &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that came here illegally,

               become a permanent resident of the United States and

               would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent
               resident.

    ROMNEY:    Now when the president ran for office, he said that
               he&#39;d put in place, in his first year, a piece of
               legislation he&#39;d file a bill in his first year that
               would reform our our immigration system, protect legal
               immigration, stop illegal immigration. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    He didn&#39;t do it. 
 
===================================
Event 475: [lines 1337-1339]

    ROMNEY:    He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, super
               majority in both Houses.

 ** ROMNEY:    Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would
               have provided an answer for &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that want to
               come legally and for &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; that are here illegally
               today?

    ROMNEY:    What&#39;s a question I think the the president will have
               a chance to answer right now. 
 
===================================
Event 476: [lines 1338-1340]

               will have a chance to answer right now.

    OBAMA:     Good, I look forward to it. 
 
===================================
Event 477: [lines 1342-1344]

    OBAMA:     I mean we&#39;re just a few miles away from Ellis Island.

 ** OBAMA:     We all understand what this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; has become
               because talent from all around the world wants to come
               here.

    OBAMA:     People are willing to take risks. 
 
===================================
Event 478: [lines 1347-1349]

    OBAMA:     So what I&#39;ve said is we need to fix a broken
               immigration system and I&#39;ve done everything that I can
               on my own and sought cooperation from Congress to make
               sure that we fix the system.

 ** OBAMA:     The first thing we did was to streamline the legal
               immigration system, to reduce the backlog, make it
               easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting
               in line, obeying the law to make sure that they can
               come here and contribute to our &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; and that&#39;s
               good for our economic growth.

    OBAMA:     They&#39;ll start new businesses. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     They&#39;ll make things happen to create jobs here in the
               United States.

 ** OBAMA:     Number two, we do have to deal with our border so we
               put more border patrol on the any time in history and
               the flow of undocumented works across the border is
               actually lower than it&#39;s been in forty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     What I&#39;ve also said is if we&#39;re going to go after
               folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly
               and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers,
               people who are hurting the community, not after
               students, not after folks who are here just because
               they&#39;re trying to figure out how to feed their
               families. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done. 
 
===================================
Event 481: [lines 1355-1357]

    OBAMA:     Had gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the
               flag.

 ** OBAMA:     Think of this as their &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Understand themselves as Americans in every way except
               having papers. 
 
===================================
Event 482: [lines 1359-1361]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s what I&#39;ve done administratively.

 ** OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney just said, you know he wants to
               help &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; young people too, but during the
               Republican primary, he said, I will veto the DREAM
               Act, that would allow these young people to have
               access.

    OBAMA:     His main strategy during the Republican primary was to
               say, We&#39;re going to encourage self deportation.

    OBAMA:     But it&#39;s very hard for Republican&#39;s in Congress to
               support comprehensive immigration reform, if their
               standard bearer has said that, this is not something
               I&#39;m interested in supporting.

               that the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; made and and and let&#39;s get them
               correct.

    ROMNEY:    I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the
               nation in that aspect. 
 
===================================
Event 486: [lines 1381-1383]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, I asked the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; I
               think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation
               have asked.

    ROMNEY:    And he didn&#39;t answer.

 ** ROMNEY:    He he doesn&#39;t answer that &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    He said the standard bearer wasn&#39;t for it.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m glad you thought I was a standard bearer four
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, but I wasn&#39;t.

 ** ROMNEY:    Four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago you said in your first year you
               would file legislation.

    ROMNEY:    In his first year, I was just getting licking my
               wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all
               right. 
 
===================================
Event 490: [lines 1391-1393]

    ROMNEY:    I was not the standard bearer.

 ** ROMNEY:    My my view is that this &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; should have
               honored his promise to do as he said.

    ROMNEY:    Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self
               deportation says let people make their own choice. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    Now, let me mention one other thing, and that is self
               deportation says let people make their own choice.

 ** ROMNEY:    What I was saying is, we&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to round up
               twelve million people, undocumented illegals, and take
               them out of the nation.

    ROMNEY:    Instead let people make their own choice. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    And if they if they find that that they can&#39;t get the
               benefits here that they want and they can&#39;t and they
               can&#39;t find the job they want, then they&#39;ll make a
               decision to go a place where where they have better
               opportunities.

 ** ROMNEY:    But I&#39;m not in favor of rounding up people and and and
               taking them out of this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    I am in favor, as the president has said, and I agree
               with him, which is that if people have committed
               crimes we got to get them out of this country.

    OBAMA:     Look, when we think about immigration, we have to
               understand there are folks all around the world who
               still see America as the land of promise.

 ** OBAMA:     And they provide us &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; and they provide us
               innovation and they start companies like Intel and
               Google.

    OBAMA:     Ah.

               folks are held accountable and it doesn&#39;t happen
               again.

 ** OBAMA:     And number three, we are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to find out who did
               this and we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to hunt them down, because
               one of the things that I&#39;ve said throughout my
               presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go

               making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own
               security, that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.

               are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to find out exactly what happened,
               everybody will be held accountable.

 ** ROMNEY:    But I find more troubling than this, that on on the
               day following the assassination of the United States
               ambassador, the first time that&#39;s happened since one
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; nine &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; seventy nine, when when

               political fund raiser, then the next day to Colorado
               for another event, other political event.

    ROMNEY:    I think these these actions taken by a president and a
               leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even
               material significance in that you&#39;d hope that during

               good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands
               didn&#39;t survive.

 ** OBAMA:     So my belief is that,, we have to enforce the laws
               we&#39;ve already got, make sure that we&#39;re keeping guns
               out of the hands of criminals, &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who are

    OBAMA:     We&#39;ve done a much better job in terms of background
               checks, but we&#39;ve got more to do when it comes to
               enforcement. 
 
===================================

               that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of
               criminals and the mentally ill.

 ** OBAMA:     But part of it is also &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; deeper and seeing if
               we can get into these communities and making sure we
               catch violent impulses before they occur.

 ** CROWLEY:   Governor Romney, the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; is about assault
               weapons, AK forty sevens.

    ROMNEY:    Yeah, I&#39;m not in favor of new pieces of legislation on
               on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns
               illegal. 
 
===================================
Event 529: [lines 1586-1588]

    OBAMA:     because I do believe that if our young people have
               opportunity, then they&#39;re less likely to engage in
               these kind of violent acts.

 ** OBAMA:     We&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to eliminate everybody who is
               mentally disturbed, and we&#39;ve got to make sure they
               don&#39;t get weapons.

               every young person in America, regardless of where

    CROWLEY:   It&#39;s for Governor Romney.

 ** QUESTION:  The outsourcing of American jobs overseas has taken a
               toll on our &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;.

    QUESTION:  What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here
               in the United States? 
 
===================================

    QUESTION:  What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here
               in the United States?

 ** ROMNEY:    Boy, great &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; and important &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;,
               because you&#39;re absolutely right.

    ROMNEY:    The place where we&#39;ve seen manufacturing go has been
               China. 
 
===================================
Event 538: [lines 1624-1626]

    ROMNEY:    A lot of good people have lost jobs.

 ** ROMNEY:    A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in

               the last four years.

 ** ROMNEY:    That&#39;s total over the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    One of the reasons for that is that people think it&#39;s
               more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to
               stay here. 
 
===================================
Event 540: [lines 1628-1630]

    ROMNEY:    We have made it less attractive for enterprises to
               stay here than to go offshore from time to time.

 ** ROMNEY:    What I will do as &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; is make sure it&#39;s more
               attractive to come to America again.

    ROMNEY:    This is the way we&#39;re going to create jobs in this
               country.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s not by trickle down government, saying we&#39;re
               going to take more money from people and hire more
               government workers, raise more taxes, put in place

    ROMNEY:    I want to make America the most attractive place in

               big business, to invest and grow in America.

 ** ROMNEY:    Now, we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to make sure that as we
               trade with other nations that they play by the rules.

    ROMNEY:    And China hasn&#39;t. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    making the same products can&#39;t compete.

 ** ROMNEY:    China has been a currency manipulator for &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;
               and &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

               label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to
               do so.

    ROMNEY:    On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator,
               which will allow me as president to be able to put in
               place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they

    ROMNEY:    But let me let me not just stop there.

 ** ROMNEY:    Don&#39;t forget, what&#39;s key to bringing back jobs here is
               not just finding someone else to punish, and I&#39;m
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be strict with people who we trade with
               to make sure they they follow the law and play by the
               rules, but it&#39;s also to make America the most
               attractive place in the world for businesses of all
               kinds.

    ROMNEY:    So if you&#39;re starting a business, where would you
               rather start it?

 ** ROMNEY:    We have to be competitive if we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to create
               more jobs here.

    ROMNEY:    Regulations have quadrupled.

    ROMNEY:    I want to make sure that regulators see their job as
               encouraging small business, not crushing it.

 ** ROMNEY:    And there&#39;s no &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; but that Obamacare has
               been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all
               kinds hiring people.

    ROMNEY:    My priority is making sure that we get more people
               hired. 
 
===================================
Event 557: [lines 1660-1662]

    ROMNEY:    My priority is making sure that we get more people
               hired.

 ** ROMNEY:    If we have more people hired, if we get back
               manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs
               into this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;, then you&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to see
               rising incomes again.

    ROMNEY:    The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is
               so high. 
 
===================================
Event 558: [lines 1663-1665]

    ROMNEY:    I know what it takes to get this to happen, and my
               plan will do that, and one part of it is to make sure
               that we keep China playing by the rules.

 ** CROWLEY:   Mister President, two minutes here, because we are
               then &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to go to our last &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     OK. 
 
===================================
Event 559: [lines 1670-1672]

    OBAMA:     I want to close loopholes that allow companies to
               deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow
               them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so
               they have tax advantages offshore.

 ** OBAMA:     All &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; changes in our tax code would make a
               difference.

    OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those
               tax breaks. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     All those changes in our tax code would make a
               difference.

 ** OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; tax breaks.

    OBAMA:     One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax
               reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you
               make profits overseas, you don&#39;t have to pay U. 
 
===================================
Event 561: [lines 1676-1678]

    OBAMA:     But, of course, if you&#39;re a small business or a mom
               and pop business or a big business starting up here,
               you&#39;ve got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor
               Romney&#39;s talking about.

 ** OBAMA:     And it&#39;s estimated that that will create eight
               &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; new jobs.

    OBAMA:     The problem is they&#39;ll be in china.

    OBAMA:     Or India. 
 
===================================

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s not the way we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to create jobs
               here.

    OBAMA:     The way we&#39;re going to create jobs here is not just to
               change our tax code, but also to double our exports.

               just to change our tax code, but also to double our
               exports.

    OBAMA:     And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the
               commitments I made when I was president.

 ** OBAMA:     And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the
               commitments I made when I was &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s creating tens of thousands of jobs all across
               the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we&#39;ve kept on pushing trade deals, but
               trade deals that make sure that American workers and
               American businesses are getting a good deal. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s what reporters called it.

 ** OBAMA:     And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has

               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; because we have pushed them hard.

    OBAMA:     And we&#39;ve put unprecedented trade pressure on China. 
 
===================================
Event 568: [lines 1692-1694]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why exports have significantly increased under
               my presidency.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to help to create jobs here.

               quick discussion here.

    ROMNEY:    We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the
               playing field is level.

    CROWLEY:   It can&#39;t be sustained.

 ** OBAMA:     Candy, there are some jobs that are not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               come back.

    OBAMA:     Because they are low wage, low skill jobs. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     And when we talk about deficits, if we&#39;re adding to
               our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don&#39;t need
               them, and we&#39;re cutting investments in research and

               next new innovation that will sell products around the
               world, we will lose that race.

               sure that we continue to lead this world &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;,
               not just next year, but ten &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; from now, fifty

    ROMNEY:    In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some
               campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather
               than prescribing their own future and the things
               they&#39;d like to do.

 ** ROMNEY:    In the course of that, I think the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s

               prosperous future for America again.

               kids, about ninety eight &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; of the adults.

    ROMNEY:    I was able also to get our schools ranked number one

    CROWLEY:   Mister President, last two minutes belong to you.

 ** OBAMA:     Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the
               last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;, has been devoted to this nation
               that I think &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; creates jobs, that that
               somehow is the answer.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 593: [lines 1778-1780]

    OBAMA:     I believe in self reliance and individual initiative
               and risk takers being rewarded.

 ** OBAMA:     But I also believe that everybody should have a fair
               shot and everybody should do their fair share and
               everybody should play by the same rules, because
               that&#39;s how our &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;&#39;s grown.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we built the world&#39;s greatest middle class. 
 
===================================
Event 594: [lines 1779-1781]

    OBAMA:     But I also believe that everybody should have a fair
               shot and everybody should do their fair share and
               everybody should play by the same rules, because
               that&#39;s how our economy&#39;s grown.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s how we built the world&#39;s greatest &lt;&lt;middle&gt;&gt;
               class.

    OBAMA:     And and that is part of what&#39;s at stake in this
               election. 
 
===================================
Event 595: [lines 1781-1783]

    OBAMA:     And and that is part of what&#39;s at stake in this
               election.

 ** OBAMA:     There&#39;s a fundamentally different vision about how we
               move our &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; forward.

    OBAMA:     I believe Governor Romney is a good man. 
 
===================================
Event 596: [lines 1784-1786]

    OBAMA:     Loves his family, cares about his faith.

 ** OBAMA:     But I also believe that when he said behind closed
               doors that forty seven &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; of the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;
               considered themselves victims who refuse personal
               responsibility, think about who he was talking about.

    OBAMA:     Folks on Social Security who&#39;ve worked all their
               lives. 
 
===================================
Event 597: [lines 1786-1788]

    OBAMA:     Folks on Social Security who&#39;ve worked all their
               lives.

 ** OBAMA:     Veterans who&#39;ve sacrificed for this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance
               their own dreams, but also this country&#39;s drea Miss
               Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right now. 
 
===================================
Event 598: [lines 1787-1789]

    OBAMA:     Veterans who&#39;ve sacrificed for this country.

 ** OBAMA:     Students who are out there trying to hopefully advance
               their own dreams, but also this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;&#39;s drea
               Miss Soldiers who are overseas fighting for us right
               now.

    OBAMA:     People who are working hard every day, paying payroll
               tax, gas taxes, but don&#39;t make enough income. 
 
===================================
Event 599: [lines 1790-1792]

    OBAMA:     And I want to fight for them.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for the last four
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Because if they succeed, I believe the country
               succeeds. 
 
===================================
Event 600: [lines 1791-1793]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing for the last four years.

 ** OBAMA:     Because if they succeed, I believe the &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;
               succeeds.

    OBAMA:     When my grandfather fought in World War II and he came
               back and he got a G. 
 
===================================
Event 601: [lines 1795-1797]

    OBAMA:     Bill and that allowed him to go to college, that
               wasn&#39;t a handout.

 ** OBAMA:     That was something that advanced the entire
               &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     And I want to make sure that the next generation has
               those same opportunities. 
 
===================================
Event 602: [lines 1796-1798]

    OBAMA:     That was something that advanced the entire country.

 ** OBAMA:     And I want to make sure that the next generation has
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; same opportunities.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking for your vote and that&#39;s why I&#39;m
               asking for another four years. 
 
===================================
Event 603: [lines 1797-1799]

    OBAMA:     And I want to make sure that the next generation has
               those same opportunities.

 ** OBAMA:     That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking for your vote and that&#39;s why I&#39;m
               asking for another four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    CROWLEY:   President Obama, Governor Romney, thank you for being
               here tonight. 
 
===================================
Event 604: [lines 1806-1808]

    SCHIEFFER: Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here
               in Boca Raton, Florida.

 ** SCHIEFFER: This is the fourth and last debate of the two
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; twelve campaign, brought to you by the
               Commission on Presidential Debates.

    SCHIEFFER: This one&#39;s on foreign policy. 
 
===================================
Event 605: [lines 1813-1815]

    SCHIEFFER: They&#39;ve asked me to divide the evening into segments.

 ** SCHIEFFER: I&#39;ll pose a &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; at the beginning of each
               segment.

    SCHIEFFER: You will each have two minutes to respond and then we
               will have a general discussion until we move to the
               next segment. 
 
===================================
Event 606: [lines 1816-1818]

    SCHIEFFER: Tonight&#39;s debate, as both of you know, comes on the
               fiftyth anniversary of the night that President
               Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had
               installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the
               closest we&#39;ve ever come to nuclear war.

 ** SCHIEFFER: And it is a sobering reminder that every &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;
               faces at some point an unexpected threat to our
               national security from abroad.

    SCHIEFFER: So let&#39;s begin. 
 
===================================
Event 607: [lines 1819-1821]

    SCHIEFFER: The first segment is the challenge of a changing
               Middle East and the new face of terrorism.

 ** SCHIEFFER: I&#39;m &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to put this into two segments so you&#39;ll
               have two topic questions within this one segment on
               the subject.

    SCHIEFFER: The first question, and it concerns Libya. 
 
===================================
Event 608: [lines 1820-1822]

    SCHIEFFER: I&#39;m going to put this into two segments so you&#39;ll have
               two topic questions within this one segment on the
               subject.

 ** SCHIEFFER: The first &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt;, and it concerns Libya.

    SCHIEFFER: The controversy over what happened there continues. 
 
===================================
Event 609: [lines 1843-1845]

    ROMNEY:    But instead, we&#39;ve seen in nation after nation, a
               number of disturbing events.

 ** ROMNEY:    Of course we see in Syria, thirty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt;
               civilians having been killed by the &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;
               there.

    ROMNEY:    We see in in Libya, an attack apparently by, I think
               we know now, by terrorists of some kind against
               against our people there, four people dead. 
 
===================================
Event 610: [lines 1847-1849]

    ROMNEY:    Mali has been taken over, the northern part of Mali by
               al Qaeda type individuals.

 ** ROMNEY:    We have in in Egypt, a Muslim Brotherhood
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    And so what we&#39;re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal
               in the kind of hopes we had for that region. 
 
===================================
Event 611: [lines 1849-1851]

    ROMNEY:    And so what we&#39;re seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal
               in the kind of hopes we had for that region.

 ** ROMNEY:    Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; closer to a nuclear weapon.

    ROMNEY:    And and we&#39;re going to have to recognize that we have
               to do as the president has done. 
 
===================================
Event 612: [lines 1850-1852]

    ROMNEY:    Of course the greatest threat of all is Iran, four
               years closer to a nuclear weapon.

 ** ROMNEY:    And and we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to recognize that we
               have to do as the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; has done.

    ROMNEY:    I congratulate him on on taking out Osama bin Laden
               and going after the leadership in al Qaeda. 
 
===================================
Event 613: [lines 1851-1853]

    ROMNEY:    And and we&#39;re going to have to recognize that we have
               to do as the president has done.

 ** ROMNEY:    I congratulate him on on taking out Osama bin Laden
               and &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; after the leadership in al Qaeda.

    ROMNEY:    But we can&#39;t kill our way out of this mess. 
 
===================================
Event 614: [lines 1853-1855]

    ROMNEY:    But we can&#39;t kill our way out of this mess.

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to put in place a very
               comprehensive and robust strategy to help the the
               world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject
               this radical violent extremism, which is it&#39;s
               certainly not on the run.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s certainly not hiding. 
 
===================================
Event 615: [lines 1858-1860]

    OBAMA:     Well, my first job as commander in chief, Bob, is to
               keep the American people safe.

 ** OBAMA:     And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done over the last four
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on
               those who actually killed us on nine/eleven. 
 
===================================
Event 616: [lines 1859-1861]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve done over the last four years.

 ** OBAMA:     We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who actually killed us on nine/eleven.

    OBAMA:     And as a consequence, Al Qaeda&#39;s core leadership has
               been decimated. 
 
===================================
Event 617: [lines 1863-1865]

    OBAMA:     And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make
               friends around the world to combat future threats.

 ** OBAMA:     Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last
               debate, when we received that phone call, I
               immediately made sure that, number one, that we did
               everything we could to secure &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; Americans who
               were still in harm&#39;s way; number two, that we would
               investigate exactly what happened, and number three,
               most importantly, that we would go after &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who
               killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re going to do. 
 
===================================
Event 618: [lines 1864-1866]

    OBAMA:     Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last
               debate, when we received that phone call, I
               immediately made sure that, number one, that we did
               everything we could to secure those Americans who were
               still in harm&#39;s way; number two, that we would

               most importantly, that we would go after those who
               killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.

 ** OBAMA:     And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to do.

    OBAMA:     But I think it&#39;s important to step back and think
               about what happened in Libya. 
 
===================================
Event 619: [lines 1866-1868]

    OBAMA:     But I think it&#39;s important to step back and think
               about what happened in Libya.

 ** OBAMA:     Keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in
               organizing an international coalition that made sure
               that we were able to, without putting troops on the
               ground at the cost of less than what we spent in two
               weeks in Iraq, liberate a &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt; that had been
               under the yoke of dictatorship for forty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a
               consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of
               thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi
               marching and saying America is our friend. 
 
===================================
Event 620: [lines 1870-1872]

    OBAMA:     Now that represents the opportunity we have to take
               advantage of.

 ** OBAMA:     And, you know, Governor Romney, I&#39;m glad that you
               agree that we have been successful in &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; after
               Al Qaida, but I have to tell you that, you know, your
               strategy previously has been one that has been all
               over the map and is not designed to keep Americans
               safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in
               the Middle East.

    ROMNEY:    Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is
               to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very
               best to interrupt them, to to kill them, to take them
               out of the picture. 
 
===================================
Event 621: [lines 1874-1876]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s that&#39;s important, of course.

 ** ROMNEY:    But the key that we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to pursue is
               a is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to
               reject extremism on its own.

    ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t want another Iraq, we don&#39;t want another
               Afghanistan. 
 
===================================
Event 622: [lines 1888-1890]

    ROMNEY:    We have to help these nations create civil societies.

 ** ROMNEY:    But what&#39;s been happening over the last couple of
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; is, as we&#39;ve watched this tumult in the
               Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see
               Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups
               rushing in.

    ROMNEY:    And and they&#39;re throughout many nations in the Middle
               East. 
 
===================================
Event 623: [lines 1896-1898]

    ROMNEY:    And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon,
               we&#39;ve got real.

 ** SCHIEFFER: We&#39;ll get to that, but let&#39;s give the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; a
               chance.

    OBAMA:     Governor Romney, I&#39;m glad that you recognize that Al
               Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you
               were asked what&#39;s the biggest geopolitical threat
               facing America, you said Russia, not Al Qaida; you
               said Russia, in the one thousand nine hundred eightys,
               they&#39;re now calling to ask for their foreign policy
               back because, you know, the Cold War&#39;s been over for
               twenty years.

    OBAMA:     But Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you
               seem to want to import the foreign policies of the one
               thousand nine hundred eightys, just like the social
               policies of the one thousand nine hundred fiftys and

               happened in Iraq. 
 
===================================
Event 626: [lines 1910-1912]

    OBAMA:     And unfortunately, that&#39;s the kind of opinions that
               you&#39;ve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not
               a recipe for American strength, or keeping America
               safe over the long haul.

 ** SCHIEFFER: I&#39;m &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to add a couple of minutes here to give
               you a chance to respond.

               said about my own record and the things that I&#39;ve
               said.

===================================
Event 628: [lines 1915-1917]

    ROMNEY:    And and attacking me is not an agenda.

 ** ROMNEY:    Attacking me is not talking about how we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle
               East, and take advantage of the opportunity there, and
               stem the tide of this violence.

    ROMNEY:    But I&#39;ll respond to a couple of things that you
               mentioned. 
 
===================================
Event 629: [lines 1925-1927]

    ROMNEY:    I have clear eyes on this.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to wear rose colored glasses when it
               comes to Russia, or Mister Putin.

 ** OBAMA:     What I would not have had done was left ten
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; troops in Iraq that would tie us down.

    OBAMA:     And that certainly would not help us in the Middle
               East. 
 
===================================
Event 632: [lines 1933-1935]

    OBAMA:     And that certainly would not help us in the Middle
               East.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;m sorry, you actually there was a there was an
               effort on the part of the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; to have a
               status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that,
               and said that we should have some number of troops
               that stayed on.

    ROMNEY:    That was something I concurred with| 
 
===================================
Event 633: [lines 1938-1940]

    ROMNEY:    That was my posture as well.

 ** ROMNEY:    You thought it should have been five &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt;
               troops|

    OBAMA:     Governor? 
 
===================================
Event 634: [lines 1966-1968]

    OBAMA:     That will help us maintain the kind of American
               leadership that we need.

 ** SCHIEFFER: Let me interject the second topic &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; in this
               segment about the Middle East and so on, and that is,
               you both mentioned alluded to this, and that is Syria.

    SCHIEFFER: The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon. 
 
===================================
Event 635: [lines 1968-1970]

    SCHIEFFER: The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon.

 ** SCHIEFFER: We have, what, more than one &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; people that
               were killed there in a bomb.

    SCHIEFFER: There were demonstrations there, eight people dead. 
 
===================================
Event 636: [lines 1971-1973]

    SCHIEFFER: Mister President, it&#39;s been more than a year since you
               saw you told Assad he had to go.

 ** SCHIEFFER: Since then, thirty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; Syrians have died.

    SCHIEFFER: We&#39;ve had three hundred thousand refugees. 
 
===================================
Event 637: [lines 1972-1974]

    SCHIEFFER: Since then, thirty thousand Syrians have died.

 ** SCHIEFFER: We&#39;ve had three &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; refugees.

    SCHIEFFER: The war goes on. 
 
===================================
Event 638: [lines 1979-1981]

    OBAMA:     What we&#39;ve done is organize the international
               community, saying Assad has to go.

 ** OBAMA:     We&#39;ve mobilized sanctions against that &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     We have made sure that they are isolated. 
 
===================================
Event 639: [lines 1982-1984]

    OBAMA:     We have provided humanitarian assistance and we are
               helping the opposition organize, and we&#39;re
               particularly interested in making sure that we&#39;re
               mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria.

 ** OBAMA:     But ultimately, Syrians are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to
               determine their own future.

    OBAMA:     And so everything we&#39;re doing, we&#39;re doing in
               consultation with our partners in the region,
               including Israel which obviously has a huge interest
               in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with
               Turkey and other countries in the region that have a
               great interest in this. 
 
===================================

               including Israel which obviously has a huge interest
               in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with
               Turkey and other countries in the region that have a
               great interest in this.

 ** OBAMA:     This what we&#39;re seeing taking place in Syria is
               heartbreaking, and that&#39;s why we are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to do
               everything we can to make sure that we are helping the
               opposition.

    OBAMA:     But we also have to recognize that, you know, for us
               to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious
               step, and we have to do so making absolutely certain
               that we know who we are helping; that we&#39;re not
               putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually
               could turn them against us or allies in the region. 
 
===================================
Event 641: [lines 1990-1992]

    ROMNEY:    Well, let&#39;s step back and talk about what&#39;s happening
               in Syria and how important it is.

 ** ROMNEY:    First of all, thirty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; people being killed
               by their &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; is a humanitarian disaster.

    ROMNEY:    Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria
               plays an important role in the Middle East,
               particularly right now. 
 
===================================
Event 642: [lines 1996-1998]

    ROMNEY:    And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high
               priority for us.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, seeing a a replacement &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;
               being responsible people is critical for us.

    ROMNEY:    And finally, we don&#39;t want to have military
               involvement there. 
 
===================================
Event 643: [lines 1997-1999]

    ROMNEY:    Number two, seeing a a replacement government being
               responsible people is critical for us.

 ** ROMNEY:    And finally, we don&#39;t want to have &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;
               involvement there.

    ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t want to get drawn into a military conflict. 
 
===================================
Event 644: [lines 1998-2000]

    ROMNEY:    And finally, we don&#39;t want to have military
               involvement there.

 ** ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t want to get drawn into a &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;
               conflict.

    ROMNEY:    And so the right course for us, is working through our
               partners and with our own resources, to identify
               responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring
               them together in a in a form of if not government, a
               form of of of council that can take the lead in Syria. 
 
===================================
Event 645: [lines 1999-2001]

    ROMNEY:    We don&#39;t want to get drawn into a military conflict.

 ** ROMNEY:    And so the right course for us, is working through our
               partners and with our own resources, to identify
               responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring
               them together in a in a form of if not &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;,
               a form of of of council that can take the lead in
               Syria.

    ROMNEY:    And then make sure they have the arms necessary to
               defend themselves. 
 
===================================
Event 646: [lines 2009-2011]

    ROMNEY:    I believe he will go.

 ** ROMNEY:    But I believe we want to make sure that we have the
               relationships of friendship with the people that take
               his place, steps that in the &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; to come we see
               Syria as a as a friend, and Syria as a responsible
               party in the Middle East.

    ROMNEY:    This this is a critical opportunity for America. 
 
===================================
Event 647: [lines 2011-2013]

    ROMNEY:    This this is a critical opportunity for America.

 ** ROMNEY:    And what I&#39;m afraid of is we&#39;ve watched over the past
               year or so, first the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; saying, well we&#39;ll
               let the U.

    ROMNEY:    N. 
 
===================================
Event 648: [lines 2014-2016]

    ROMNEY:    deal with it.

 ** ROMNEY:    And Assad excuse me, Kofi Annan came in and said we&#39;re
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to try to have a ceasefire.

    ROMNEY:    That didn&#39;t work. 
 
===================================
Event 649: [lines 2017-2019]

    ROMNEY:    Then it went to the Russians and said, let&#39;s see if
               you can do something.

 ** ROMNEY:    We should be playing the leadership role there, not on
               the ground with &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;.

    SCHIEFFER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 650: [lines 2023-2025]

    OBAMA:     We are mobilizing humanitarian support, and support
               for the opposition.

 ** OBAMA:     And we are making sure that &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; we help are
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who will be friends of ours in the long term
               and friends of our allies in the region over the long
               term.

    OBAMA:     But going back to Libya because this is an example of
               how we make choices. 
 
===================================
Event 651: [lines 2024-2026]

    OBAMA:     And we are making sure that those we help are those
               who will be friends of ours in the long term and
               friends of our allies in the region over the long
               term.

 ** OBAMA:     But &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; back to Libya because this is an example
               of how we make choices.

    OBAMA:     When we went in to Libya, and we were able to
               immediately stop the massacre there, because of the
               unique circumstances and the coalition that we had
               helped to organize. 
 
===================================
Event 652: [lines 2027-2029]

    OBAMA:     We also had to make sure that Moammar Gadhafi didn&#39;t
               stay there.

 ** OBAMA:     And to the &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt;&#39;s credit, you supported us
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; into Libya and the coalition that we
               organized.

    OBAMA:     But when it came time to making sure that Gadhafi did
               not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor,
               your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that
               this was mission muddle. 
 
===================================
Event 653: [lines 2031-2033]

    OBAMA:     You know, Moammar Gadhafi had more American blood on
               his hands than any individual other than Osama bin
               Laden.

 ** OBAMA:     And so we were &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to make sure that we finished
               the job.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s part of the reason why the Libyans stand with
               us. 
 
===================================
Event 654: [lines 2033-2035]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s part of the reason why the Libyans stand with
               us.

 ** OBAMA:     But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making
               certain that we knew who we were dealing with, that
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; forces of moderation on the ground were ones
               that we could work with, and we have to take the same
               kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to
               Syria.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing. 
 
===================================
Event 655: [lines 2036-2038]

    SCHIEFFER: Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what
               the administration would do, like for example, would
               you put in no fly zones over Syria?

 ** ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t want to have our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; involved in
               Syria.

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t think there is a necessity to put our military
               in Syria at this stage. 
 
===================================
Event 656: [lines 2037-2039]

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t want to have our military involved in Syria.

 ** ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t think there is a necessity to put our
               &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; in Syria at this stage.

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t anticipate that in the future. 
 
===================================
Event 657: [lines 2039-2041]

    ROMNEY:    I don&#39;t anticipate that in the future.

 ** ROMNEY:    As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad
               and to have in place a new &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; which is
               friendly to us, a responsible &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;, if
               possible.

    ROMNEY:    And I want to make sure they get armed and they have
               the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to
               remove to remove Assad. 
 
===================================

               the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to
               remove to remove Assad.

 ** ROMNEY:    But I do not want to see a &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; involvement on
               the part of our of our troops.

    SCHIEFFER: Well | 
 
===================================

    SCHIEFFER: Well |

 ** ROMNEY:    And this isn&#39;t this isn&#39;t &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be necessary.

    OBAMA:     No, I don&#39;t, because I think that America has to stand
               with democracy.

 ** OBAMA:     The notion that we would have tanks run over &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt;
               young people who were in Tahrir Square, that is not
               the kind of American leadership that John F.

 ** OBAMA:     Kennedy talked about fifty &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago.

    OBAMA:     But what I&#39;ve also said is that now that you have a
               democratically elected government in Egypt, that they
               have to make sure that they take responsibility for

    OBAMA:     And we have put significant pressure on them to make
               sure they&#39;re doing that; to recognize the rights of
               women, which is critical throughout the region.

 ** OBAMA:     And we will help them with respect to developing their
               own &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;, because ultimately what&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the
               people of Egypt, but also for the world, is if
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; young people who gathered there are seeing
               opportunities.

 ** OBAMA:     And so one of the things that we&#39;ve been doing is, is,
               for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences

               like Iraq and Afghanistan and we&#39;ve neglected, for

               with our friend and with other friends in the region
               to have them make the transition towards a more
               representative form of &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;, such that it
               didn&#39;t explode in the way that it did.

    ROMNEY:    But once it exploded, I felt the same as the president
               did, which is these freedom voices and the streets of
               Egypt, where the people who were speaking of our
               principles and the President Mubarak had done things
               which were unimaginable and the idea of him crushing

               in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship
               in some ways that existed between us.

 ** ROMNEY:    And then, of course, with regards to standing for our
               principles, when when the students took to the streets
               in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green
               Revolution occurred, for the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; to be
               silent I thought was an enormous mistake.

    ROMNEY:    We have to stand for our principles, stand for our
               allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a
               stronger economy.

Event 702: [lines 2148-2150]

    OBAMA:     It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and
               relationships that had been neglected for a decade.

 ** OBAMA:     And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been
               stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel,
               where we have unprecedented &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; and
               intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the
               Iranian threat.

    OBAMA:     But what we also have been able to do is position
               ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and
               that&#39;s what my plan does. 
 
===================================
Event 703: [lines 2152-2154]

    OBAMA:     Making sure that we&#39;ve got the best education system
               in the world, including retraining our workers for the
               jobs of tomorrow.

 ** OBAMA:     Doing everything we can to control our own &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     We&#39;ve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two
               decades because we&#39;ve developed oil and natural gas.

 ** OBAMA:     But we also have to develop clean &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt;
               technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in
               half by two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; twenty.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s the kind of leadership that we need to show. 
 
===================================
Event 705: [lines 2163-2165]

    OBAMA:     He&#39;s praised George Bush as a good economic steward
               and Dick Cheney as somebody who&#39;s who shows great
               wisdom and judgment.

 ** OBAMA:     And taking us back to &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; kinds of strategies
               that got us into this mess are not the way that we are
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to maintain leadership in the twenty onest

               know what it takes to create twelve million new jobs
               and rising take home pay.

               home pay again, and I&#39;ll do it with five simple steps.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number one, we are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have North American
               &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; independence.

               America. 
 
===================================
Event 715: [lines 2179-2181]

    ROMNEY:    The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just
               not taken advantage of fully.

 ** ROMNEY:    As a matter of fact, Latin America&#39;s &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; is
               almost as big as the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; of China.

               language opportunities.

               programs that work for our workers and schools that
               finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids
               first, and the teachers&#39; unions &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to
               go behind.

 ** ROMNEY:    And then we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to get to a balanced
               budget.

    ROMNEY:    We can&#39;t expect entrepreneurs and businesses large and
               small to take their life savings or their company&#39;s
               money and invest in America if they think we&#39;re headed

               finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.

               make a difference in the twenty onest century and
               that&#39;s our education policy.

    OBAMA:     We didn&#39;t have a lot of chance to talk about this in
               the last debate. 
 
===================================
Event 721: [lines 2204-2206]

    OBAMA:     And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers,
               especially in math and science, because we know that
               we&#39;ve fallen behind when it comes to math and science.

 ** OBAMA:     And &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; teachers can make a difference.

    OBAMA:     Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers
               whether or not this would help the economy grow, you
               said this isn&#39;t going to help the economy grow.

               grow.

               said class sizes don&#39;t make a difference. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will
               tell you it does make a difference.

 ** OBAMA:     And if we&#39;ve got math teachers who are able to provide
               the kind of support that they need for our kids,
               that&#39;s what&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to determine whether or not
               the new businesses are created here.

    OBAMA:     Companies are going to locate here depending on
               whether we&#39;ve got the most highly skilled workforce. 
 
===================================

               forward, when we don&#39;t ask either you or me to pay a
               dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but
               instead we slash support for education, that&#39;s
               undermining our long term competitiveness.

               graders came out number one of all fifty states in
               English, and then also in math.

               that focused on having great teachers in the
               classroom.

    ROMNEY:    Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to
               keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor;
               we&#39;ll take that healthcare program for the poor and we
               give it to the states to run because states run these
               programs more efficiently.

 ** ROMNEY:    As a &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt;, I thought please, give me this
               program.

               that he&#39;s going to do it. 
 
===================================
Event 742: [lines 2267-2269]

    OBAMA:     Look, Governor Romney&#39;s called for dollar five
               trillion of tax cuts that he says he&#39;s going to pay
               for by closing deductions.

 ** OBAMA:     Now, the math doesn&#39;t work, but he continues to claim
               that he&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to do it.

               military spending that our military is not asking for.

               gone up every single year that I&#39;ve been in office.

    OBAMA:     We spend more on our military than the next ten
               countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United
               Kingdom, you name it.

===================================
Event 746: [lines 2272-2274]

    OBAMA:     The next ten.

 ** OBAMA:     And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff
               to think about, what are we &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to need in the
               future to make sure that we are safe?

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s the budget that we&#39;ve put forward. 
 
===================================
Event 747: [lines 2274-2276]

    OBAMA:     And that&#39;s the budget that we&#39;ve put forward.

 ** OBAMA:     But, what you can&#39;t do is spend &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; two
               trillion in additional &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; spending that the
               &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; is not asking for, &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; five
               trillion on tax cuts.

    OBAMA:     You say that you&#39;re going to pay for it by closing
               loopholes and deductions, without naming what those

===================================

    OBAMA:     The math simply doesn&#39;t work.

 ** OBAMA:     But when it comes to our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;, what we have to
               think about is not, you know just budgets, we&#39;ve got
               to think about capabilities.

    OBAMA:     We need to be thinking about cyber security. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s not driven by members of Congress, and what they
               would like to see.

 ** OBAMA:     It&#39;s driven by, what are we &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to need to keep
               the American people safe?

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s exactly what our budget does, and it also then
               allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a
               significant national security concern.

               significant national security concern.

 ** OBAMA:     Because we&#39;ve got to make sure that our &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; is
               strong at home so that we can project &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt;
               power overseas.

 ** ROMNEY:    I was on the world of business for twenty five
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

               business.

    ROMNEY:    I went into the Olympics that was out of balance, and
               we got it on balance, and made a success there.

 ** ROMNEY:    I had the chance to be &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt; of a state.

               &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; seventeen.

 ** ROMNEY:    The Navy said they needed three &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; thirteen

               through a sequestration. 
 
===================================
Event 762: [lines 2306-2308]

    ROMNEY:    I want to make sure that we have the ships that are
               required by our Navy.

 ** ROMNEY:    Our Air Force is older and smaller than at any time
               since it was founded in one &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; nine
               &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; forty seven.

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;ve changed for the first time since FDR since FDR
               we had the we&#39;ve always had the strategy of saying we
               could fight in two conflicts at once. 
 
===================================
Event 763: [lines 2310-2312]

    ROMNEY:    Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility
               of the President of the United States, which is to
               maintain the safety of the American people.

 ** ROMNEY:    And I will not cut our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; budget by a
               trillion dollars, which is a combination of the budget
               cuts the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; has, as well as the
               sequestration cuts.

    ROMNEY:    That, in my view, is making is making our future less
               certain and less secure. 
 
===================================
Event 764: [lines 2316-2318]

    OBAMA:     It will not happen.

 ** OBAMA:     The budget that we are talking about is not reducing
               our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; spending.

    OBAMA:     It is maintaining it. 
 
===================================
Event 765: [lines 2318-2320]

    OBAMA:     It is maintaining it.

 ** OBAMA:     But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn&#39;t spent enough
               time looking at how our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; works.

    OBAMA:     You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have
               fewer ships than we did in one thousand nine hundred
               sixteen. 
 
===================================

               fewer ships than we did in one &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; nine
               &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; sixteen.

    OBAMA:     Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and
               bayonets, because the nature of our military&#39;s
               changed. 
 
===================================
Event 767: [lines 2320-2322]

    OBAMA:     You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have

               changed.

    OBAMA:     We have these things called aircraft carriers, where
               planes land on them. 
 
===================================
Event 768: [lines 2323-2325]

    OBAMA:     We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear
               submarines.

 ** OBAMA:     And so the &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; is not a game of Battleship,
               where we&#39;re counting slips.

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s what are our capabilities. 
 
===================================
Event 769: [lines 2325-2327]

    OBAMA:     It&#39;s what are our capabilities.

 ** OBAMA:     And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy
               and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be best able to meet all of our defense
               needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops,
               that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind
               of support that they need when they come home.

    OBAMA:     And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that
               you&#39;re putting forward because it just doesn&#39;t work. 
 
===================================
Event 770: [lines 2342-2344]

    OBAMA:     I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.

 ** OBAMA:     And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we
               have created the strongest &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; and
               intelligence cooperation between our two countries in
               history.

    OBAMA:     In fact, this week we&#39;ll be carrying out the largest
               military exercise with Israel in history, this very
               week.

               &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; exercise with Israel in history, this
               very week.

    OBAMA:     But to the issue of Iran, as long as I&#39;m president of
               the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon. 
 
===================================
Event 772: [lines 2344-2346]

               of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear
               weapon.

    OBAMA:     I made that clear when I came into office. 
 
===================================
Event 773: [lines 2346-2348]

    OBAMA:     I made that clear when I came into office.

 ** OBAMA:     We then organized the strongest coalition and the
               strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is
               crippling their &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Their currency has dropped eighty percent. 
 
===================================

               crippling their economy.

 ** OBAMA:     Their currency has dropped eighty &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level

               ago. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     Their currency has dropped eighty percent.

 ** OBAMA:     Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level
               since they were fighting a war with Iraq twenty
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago.

    OBAMA:     So their economy is in a shambles. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level
               since they were fighting a war with Iraq twenty years
               ago.

 ** OBAMA:     So their &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt; is in a shambles.

    OBAMA:     And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran
               is a threat to our national security, and it is a
               threat to Israel&#39;s national security. 
 
===================================
Event 777: [lines 2356-2358]

    OBAMA:     So the work that we&#39;ve done with respect to sanctions
               now offers Iran a choice.

 ** OBAMA:     They can take the diplomatic route and end their
               nuclear program or they will have to face a united
               world and a United States &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;, me, who said
               we&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to take any options off the table.

    OBAMA:     The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that,
               during the course of this campaign, he&#39;s often talked
               as if we should take premature military action. 
 
===================================
Event 778: [lines 2357-2359]

    OBAMA:     They can take the diplomatic route and end their
               nuclear program or they will have to face a united
               world and a United States president, me, who said

               as if we should take premature &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; action.

    OBAMA:     I think that would be a mistake, because when I&#39;ve
               sent young men and women into harm&#39;s way, I always
               understand that that is the last resort, not the first
               resort. 
 
===================================
Event 779: [lines 2360-2362]

    SCHIEFFER: Two minutes.

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same
               point the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; made which is that if I&#39;m
               President of the United States, when I&#39;m President of
               the United States, we will stand with Israel.

    ROMNEY:    And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not
               just diplomatically, not just culturally, but
               militarily. 
 
===================================
Event 780: [lines 2363-2365]

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of
               Iran, there&#39;s no &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; but that a nuclear Iran,
               a nuclear capable Iran is unacceptable to America.

    ROMNEY:    It presents a threat not only to our friends but
               ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear
               material, nuclear weapons that could be used against
               us or used to be threatening to us. 
 
===================================
Event 781: [lines 2366-2368]

    ROMNEY:    It is also essential for us to understand what our
               mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from
               having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and
               diplomatic means.

 ** ROMNEY:    And crippling sanctions are something I called for
               five &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at
               the Herzliya Conference.

    ROMNEY:    I laid out seven steps, crippling sanctions were
               number one. 
 
===================================
Event 782: [lines 2369-2371]

    ROMNEY:    And they do work.

 ** ROMNEY:    You&#39;re seeing it right now in the &lt;&lt;economy&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s absolutely the right thing to do, to have
               crippling sanctions. 
 
===================================
Event 783: [lines 2373-2375]

    ROMNEY:    But it&#39;s good that we have them.

 ** ROMNEY:    Number two, something I would add today is I would
               tighten &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; sanctions.

    ROMNEY:    I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil, can&#39;t
               come into our ports. 
 
===================================
Event 784: [lines 2379-2381]

    ROMNEY:    Not only ships couldn&#39;t, but I&#39;d say companies that
               are moving their oil can&#39;t, people who are trading in
               their oil can&#39;t.

 ** ROMNEY:    I would tighten &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; sanctions further.

    ROMNEY:    Secondly, I&#39;d take on diplomatic isolation efforts. 
 
===================================
Event 785: [lines 2387-2389]

    ROMNEY:    We need to increase pressure time, and time again on
               Iran because anything other than a a a solution to
               this, which says which stops this this nuclear folly
               of theirs, is unacceptable to America.

 ** ROMNEY:    And of course, a &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; action is the last
               resort.

    ROMNEY:    It is something one would only only consider if all of
               the other avenues had been had been tried to their
               full extent. 
 
===================================
Event 786: [lines 2392-2394]

    SCHIEFFER: What is the deal that you would accept, Mister
               President?

 ** OBAMA:     Well, first of all &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; are reports in the
               newspaper.

    OBAMA:     They are not true. 
 
===================================
Event 787: [lines 2414-2416]

    OBAMA:     But over time, what they can do is regain credibility.

 ** OBAMA:     In the meantime, though, we&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to let up
               the pressure until we have clear evidence that that
               takes place.

    OBAMA:     And one last thing just just to make this point. 
 
===================================
Event 788: [lines 2417-2419]

    OBAMA:     The clock is ticking.

 ** OBAMA:     We&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to allow Iran to perpetually
               engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.

    OBAMA:     And I&#39;ve been very clear to them. 
 
===================================
Event 789: [lines 2421-2423]

    OBAMA:     And that clock is ticking.

 ** OBAMA:     And we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to make sure that if they do not
               meet the demands of the international community, then
               we are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to take all options necessary to make
               sure they don&#39;t have a nuclear weapon.

    SCHIEFFER: Governor? 
 
===================================
Event 790: [lines 2425-2427]

    ROMNEY:    I think they saw weakness where they had expected to
               find American strength.

 ** ROMNEY:    And I say that because from the very beginning, the
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; in his campaign four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago, said
               he would meet with all the world&#39;s worst actors in his
               first year, he&#39;d sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong il,
               with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran.

    ROMNEY:    And I think they looked and thought, well, that&#39;s an
               unusual honor to receive from the President of the
               United States. 
 
===================================
Event 791: [lines 2427-2429]

    ROMNEY:    And I think they looked and thought, well, that&#39;s an
               unusual honor to receive from the President of the
               United States.

 ** ROMNEY:    And then the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; began what I have called an
               apology tour, of &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to various nations in the
               Middle East and criticizing America.

    ROMNEY:    I think they looked at that and saw weakness. 
 
===================================
Event 792: [lines 2429-2431]

    ROMNEY:    I think they looked at that and saw weakness.

 ** ROMNEY:    Then when there were dissidents in the streets of
               Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is
               America with us, the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; was silent.

    ROMNEY:    I think they noticed that as well. 
 
===================================
Event 793: [lines 2431-2433]

    ROMNEY:    I think they noticed that as well.

 ** ROMNEY:    And I think that when the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; said he was
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to create daylight between ourselves and
               Israel, that they noticed that as well.

    ROMNEY:    All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian
               mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing
               along here, we can keep talks going on, we&#39;re just
               going to keep on spinning centrifuges. 
 
===================================
Event 794: [lines 2432-2434]

    ROMNEY:    And I think that when the president said he was going
               to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that
               they noticed that as well.

 ** ROMNEY:    All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian
               mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing
               along here, we can keep talks &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; on, we&#39;re just
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to keep on spinning centrifuges.

    ROMNEY:    Now there are some ten thousand centrifuges spinning
               uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the
               United States and to the world. 
 
===================================
Event 795: [lines 2433-2435]

    ROMNEY:    All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian
               mullahs that, hey, you know, we can keep on pushing
               along here, we can keep talks going on, we&#39;re just
               going to keep on spinning centrifuges.

 ** ROMNEY:    Now there are some ten &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; centrifuges
               spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat
               to the United States and to the world.

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s unacceptable for us, and it&#39;s essential for a
               president to show strength from the very beginning, to
               make it very clear what is acceptable and not
               acceptable. 
 
===================================
Event 796: [lines 2434-2436]

    ROMNEY:    Now there are some ten thousand centrifuges spinning
               uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the
               United States and to the world.

 ** ROMNEY:    That&#39;s unacceptable for us, and it&#39;s essential for a
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; to show strength from the very
               beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable
               and not acceptable.

    ROMNEY:    And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to
               us. 
 
===================================
Event 797: [lines 2441-2443]

    ROMNEY:    We need to indict Ahmadinejad.

 ** ROMNEY:    We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we
               possibly can, because if we do that, we won&#39;t have to
               take the &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; action.

    OBAMA:     Bob, let me just respond. 
 
===================================
Event 798: [lines 2448-2450]

    OBAMA:     And the fact is, while we were coordinating an
               international coalition to make sure these sanctions
               were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese
               state oil company that was doing business with the
               Iranian oil sector.

 ** OBAMA:     So I&#39;ll let the American people decide, judge, who&#39;s
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be more effective and more credible when
               it comes to imposing crippling sanctions.

    OBAMA:     And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian
               revolution, I was very clear about the murderous
               activities that had taken place and that was contrary
               to international law and everything that civilized
               people stand for. 
 
===================================
Event 799: [lines 2453-2455]

    OBAMA:     Iran was resurgent.

 ** OBAMA:     Iran is at its weakest point, economically,
               strategically, militarily, then since then in many
               &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on
               to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon. 
 
===================================
Event 800: [lines 2454-2456]

    OBAMA:     Iran is at its weakest point, economically,
               strategically, militarily, then since then in many
               years.

 ** OBAMA:     And we are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to continue to keep the pressure
               on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s in America&#39;s national interest and that will be
               the case so long as I&#39;m president. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s in America&#39;s national interest and that will be

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;re four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; closer to a nuclear Iran.

    ROMNEY:    And and we should not have wasted these four years to
               the extent they they continue to be able to spin these
               centrifuges and get that much closer.

    ROMNEY:    That&#39;s number one. 
 
===================================
Event 805: [lines 2463-2465]

    ROMNEY:    And by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.

 ** ROMNEY:    And then in &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; nations, and on Arabic TV, you
               said that America had been dismissive and derisive.

    ROMNEY:    You said that on occasion America had dictated to
               other nations. 
 
===================================
Event 806: [lines 2468-2470]

    OBAMA:     Bob, let me let me respond.

 ** OBAMA:     If we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to talk about trips that we&#39;ve
               taken when I was a candidate for office, first trip I
               took was to visit our troops.

    OBAMA:     And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn&#39;t
               take donors. 
 
===================================
Event 807: [lines 2473-2475]

    OBAMA:     And then I went down to the border towns of Storok,
               which had experienced missiles raining dowm from
               Hamas.

 ** OBAMA:     And I saw families there who showed me there where
               missiles had come down near their children&#39;s bedroo
               Miss And I was reminded of what that would mean if
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; were my kids.

    OBAMA:     Which is why as president, we funded an Iron Dome
               program to stop those missiles. 
 
===================================
Event 808: [lines 2474-2476]

    OBAMA:     And I saw families there who showed me there where

               program to stop &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; missiles.

    OBAMA:     So that&#39;s how I&#39;ve used my travels, when I travel to
               Israel and when I travel to the region. 
 
===================================
Event 809: [lines 2476-2478]

    OBAMA:     So that&#39;s how I&#39;ve used my travels, when I travel to
               Israel and when I travel to the region.

 ** OBAMA:     And the the central &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; at this point is
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be: Who is &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be credible to
               all parties involved?

    OBAMA:     And they can look at my track record, whether it&#39;s
               Iran sanctions, whether it&#39;s dealing with
               counterterrorism, whether it&#39;s supporting democracy,
               whether it&#39;s supporting women&#39;s rights, whether it&#39;s
               supporting religious minorities.

    SCHIEFFER: What if what if the prime minister of Israel called
               you on the phone and said, Our bombers are on the way.

 ** ROMNEY:    Let&#39;s come back to what the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; was speaking
               about, which is what&#39;s happening in the world and the
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;&#39;s statement that things are &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; so
               well.

    ROMNEY:    They&#39;re very strong.

 ** ROMNEY:    I see Syria with thirty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; civilians dead,
               Assad still in power.

    ROMNEY:    I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it&#39;s
               growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.

               technology, Russia said they&#39;re not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               follow Nunn Lugar any more.

               that we had with them.

    ROMNEY:    I look around the world, I don&#39;t see our influence
               growing around the world.

 ** ROMNEY:    I see our influence receding, in part because of the
               failure of the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; to deal with our economic
               challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal
               from our commitment to our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; in the way I
               think it ought to be; in part because of the the the
               turmoil with Israel.

    ROMNEY:    I mean, the president received a letter from thirty
               eight Democrat senators saying the tensions with

    OBAMA:     I mean, I&#39;m I&#39;m pleased that you now are endorsing our
               policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially
               having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end
               their nuclear program.

 ** OBAMA:     But just a few &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; ago you said that&#39;s something
               you&#39;d never do.

    OBAMA:     In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable

               should have twenty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; more folks in there.

    OBAMA:     But when you were a candidate in two thousand eight,
               as I was, and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights
               I would take that shot, you said we shouldn&#39;t move

 ** OBAMA:     You know, after we killed bin Laden I was at ground
               zero for a memorial and talked to a young women who
               was four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; old when nine/eleven happened.

    OBAMA:     And the last conversation she had with her father was
               him calling from the twin towers, saying Peyton, I
               love you and I will always watch over you. 
 
===================================
Event 822: [lines 2521-2523]

    OBAMA:     And she said to me, You know, by finally getting bin
               Laden, that brought some closure to me.

 ** OBAMA:     And when we do things like that when we bring
               &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who have harmed us to justice, that sends a
               message to the world and it tells Peyton that we did
               not forget her father.

    OBAMA:     And I make that point because that&#39;s the kind of
               clarity of leadership, and those decisions are not
               always popular.

               tested. 
 
===================================
Event 824: [lines 2524-2526]

    OBAMA:     Those decisions generally generally are not poll
               tested.

 ** OBAMA:     And even some in my own party, including my current
               vice &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;, had the same critique as you did.

    OBAMA:     But what the American people understand is that I look
               at what we need to get done to keep the American
               people safe and to move our interests forward, and I
               make those decisions.

    SCHIEFFER: All right, let&#39;s go. 
 
===================================
Event 826: [lines 2530-2532]

    SCHIEFFER: Governor, you get to go first.

 ** ROMNEY:    You can&#39;t but you can&#39;t have the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; just
               lay out a whole series of items without giving me a
               chance to respond.

    SCHIEFFER: With respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program| 
 
===================================
Event 827: [lines 2534-2536]

    SCHIEFFER: We&#39;ll give you we&#39;ll catch up.

 ** SCHIEFFER: The United States is scheduled to turn over
               responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the
               Afghan &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; in two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; fourteen.

    SCHIEFFER: At that point, we will withdraw our combat troops,
               leave a smaller force of Americans, if I understand
               our policy, in Afghanistan for training purposes. 
 
===================================
Event 828: [lines 2536-2538]

    SCHIEFFER: At that point, we will withdraw our combat troops,
               leave a smaller force of Americans, if I understand
               our policy, in Afghanistan for training purposes.

 ** SCHIEFFER: It seems to me the key &lt;&lt;question&gt;&gt; here is: What do
               you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the
               Afghans are unable to handle their security?

    SCHIEFFER: Do we still leave? 
 
===================================
Event 829: [lines 2539-2541]

    SCHIEFFER: And I believe, Governor Romney, you go first?

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be finished by two
               &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; fourteen, and when I&#39;m &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt;,
               we&#39;ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of
               two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; fourteen.

    ROMNEY:    The commanders and the generals there are on track to
               do so. 
 
===================================
Event 830: [lines 2541-2543]

    ROMNEY:    The commanders and the generals there are on track to
               do so.

 ** ROMNEY:    We&#39;ve seen progress over the past several &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    The surge has been successful and the training program
               is proceeding apace. 
 
===================================
Event 831: [lines 2543-2545]

    ROMNEY:    The surge has been successful and the training program
               is proceeding apace.

 ** ROMNEY:    There are now a large number of Afghan Security
               Forces, three &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; fifty &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; that are
               ready to step in to provide security and we&#39;re
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be able to make that transition by the
               end of two &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; fourteen.

    ROMNEY:    So our troops will come home at that point. 
 
===================================
Event 832: [lines 2545-2547]

    ROMNEY:    So our troops will come home at that point.

 ** ROMNEY:    I can tell you at the same time, that we will make
               sure that we look at what&#39;s happening in Pakistan, and
               recognize that what&#39;s happening in Pakistan is
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have a major impact on the success in
               Afghanistan.

    ROMNEY:    And I say that because I know a lot of people that
               feel like we should just brush our hands and walk
               away. 
 
===================================
Event 833: [lines 2548-2550]

    ROMNEY:    And I don&#39;t mean you, Mister President, but some
               people in the in our nation feel that Pakistan is
               being nice to us, and that we should walk away fro
               mthem.

 ** ROMNEY:    But Pakistan is important to the region, to the world
               and to us, because Pakistan has one &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt;
               nuclear warheads and they&#39;re rushing to build a lot
               more.

    ROMNEY:    They&#39;ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the
               in the relatively near future. 
 
===================================
Event 834: [lines 2550-2552]

    ROMNEY:    They&#39;ll have more than Great Britain sometime in the
               in the relatively near future.

 ** ROMNEY:    They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban
               existent within their &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed
               state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan
               and to us. 
 
===================================
Event 835: [lines 2552-2554]

    ROMNEY:    And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed
               state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan
               and to us.

 ** ROMNEY:    And so we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to remain helpful in
               encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable
               &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; and rebuild the relationship with us.

    ROMNEY:    And that means that our aid that we provide to
               Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon
               certain benchmarks being met. 
 
===================================
Event 836: [lines 2553-2555]

    ROMNEY:    And so we&#39;re going to have to remain helpful in
               encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable
               government and rebuild the relationship with us.

 ** ROMNEY:    And that means that our aid that we provide to
               Pakistan is &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to be conditioned upon
               certain benchmarks being met.

    ROMNEY:    So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move
               Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get
               Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the
               end of two thousand fourteen. 
 
===================================
Event 837: [lines 2554-2556]

    ROMNEY:    And that means that our aid that we provide to
               Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon
               certain benchmarks being met.

 ** ROMNEY:    So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move
               Pakistan in the right direction, and also to get
               Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the

    SCHIEFFER: Mister President? 
 
===================================
Event 838: [lines 2561-2563]

    OBAMA:     Part of what had happened is we&#39;d forgotten why we had
               gone.

 ** OBAMA:     We went because there were people who were responsible
               for three &lt;&lt;thousand&gt;&gt; American deaths.

    OBAMA:     And so we decimated Al Qaida&#39;s core leadership in the
               border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 
===================================
Event 839: [lines 2564-2566]

    OBAMA:     We then started to build up Afghan forces.

 ** OBAMA:     And we&#39;re now in a position where we can transition
               out, because there&#39;s no reason why Americans should
               die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending
               their own &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     Now, that transition has to take place in a
               responsible fashion. 
 
===================================
Event 840: [lines 2571-2573]

    OBAMA:     When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he
               had to start from scratch.

 ** OBAMA:     And what we&#39;ve said is let&#39;s change &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt;
               certifications.

    OBAMA:     The first lady has done great work with an
               organization called Joining Forces putting our
               veterans back to work. 
 
===================================
Event 841: [lines 2575-2577]

    OBAMA:     It was higher when I came into office.

 ** OBAMA:     So &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; are the kinds of things that we can now
               do because we&#39;re making that transition in
               Afghanistan.

    SCHIEFFER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 842: [lines 2582-2584]

    SCHIEFFER: Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan?

 ** ROMNEY:    No, it&#39;s not time to divorce a nation on Earth that
               has one &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; nuclear weapons and is on the way
               to double that at some point, a nation that has
               serious threats from terrorist groups within its
               nation, as I indicated before, the Taliban, Haqqani
               Network.

    ROMNEY:    It&#39;s a nation that&#39;s not like like others and it does
               not have a civilian leadership that is calling the
               shots there. 
 
===================================
Event 843: [lines 2585-2587]

    ROMNEY:    You have the ISI, their intelligence organization, is
               probably the most powerful of the of three branches
               there.

 ** ROMNEY:    Then you have the &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; and then you have the
               civilian &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it if
               it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons
               there and you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got terrorists there who
               could grab their their hands onto those nuclear
               weapons. 
 
===================================
Event 844: [lines 2586-2588]

    ROMNEY:    Then you have the military and then you have the
               civilian government.

 ** ROMNEY:    This is a nation, which, if it falls apart, if it if
               it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons
               there and you&#39;ve got you&#39;ve got terrorists there who
               could grab their their hands onto &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; nuclear
               weapons.

    ROMNEY:    This is this is an important part of the world for us. 
 
===================================
Event 845: [lines 2595-2597]

    ROMNEY:    And and that upset them, but obviously there was a
               great deal of anger even before that.

 ** ROMNEY:    But we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to work with the with the
               people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more
               responsible course than the one that they&#39;re on.

    ROMNEY:    And it&#39;s important for them. 
 
===================================
Event 846: [lines 2600-2602]

    ROMNEY:    Because inside Pakistan, you have a a large group of
               Pashtun that are that are Taliban.

 ** ROMNEY:    They&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to come rushing back in to
               Afghanistan when we go.

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s one of the reasons the Afghan Security
               Forces have so much work to do to be able to fight
               against that. 
 
===================================
Event 847: [lines 2606-2608]

    ROMNEY:    Well I believe we should use any and all means
               necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us
               and our friends around the world.

 ** ROMNEY:    And it&#39;s widely reported that drones are being used in
               drone strikes, and I support that and entirely, and
               feel the &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; was right to up the usage of
               that technology, and believe that we should continue
               to use it, to continue to go after the people that
               represent a threat to this nation and to our friends.

    ROMNEY:    But let me also note that as I said earlier, we&#39;re
               going to have to do more than just going after leaders
               and and killing bad guys, important as that is.

               is.

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;re also going to have to have a farm more effective
               and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away
               from terror and Islamic extremism.

    ROMNEY:    We haven&#39;t done that yet. 
 
===================================
Event 850: [lines 2611-2613]

    ROMNEY:    We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the
               the record, you look at the record.

 ** ROMNEY:    You look at the record of the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; and
               say is Iran closer to a bomb?

    ROMNEY:    Yes. 
 
===================================
Event 851: [lines 2618-2620]

    ROMNEY:    Is are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching
               a peace agreement?

 ** ROMNEY:    No, they haven&#39;t had talks in two &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I&#39;m
               convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to
               build a strategy based upon helping these nations
               reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and
               prosperity the world demands.

 ** OBAMA:     Well, keep in mind our strategy wasn&#39;t just &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt;
               after bin Laden.

    OBAMA:     We created partnerships throughout the region to deal
               with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan. 
 
===================================
Event 853: [lines 2622-2624]

    OBAMA:     We created partnerships throughout the region to deal
               with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.

 ** OBAMA:     And what we&#39;ve also done is engaged these governments
               in the kind of reforms that are actually &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to
               make a difference in people&#39;s lives day to day, to
               make sure that their governments aren&#39;t corrupt, to
               make sure that they&#39;re treating women with the kind of
               respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds
               has shown and to make sure that they&#39;ve got a free
               market system that works.

    OBAMA:     So across the board, we are engaging them in building
               capacity in these countries. 
 
===================================
Event 854: [lines 2625-2627]

    OBAMA:     And we have stood on the side of democracy.

 ** OBAMA:     One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when
               Tunisians began to protest, this nation me, my
               administration stood with them earlier than just about
               any &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;.

    OBAMA:     In Egypt we stood on the side of democracy. 
 
===================================
Event 855: [lines 2629-2631]

    OBAMA:     And as a consequence, there&#39;s no doubt that attitudes
               about Americans have changed.

 ** OBAMA:     But there are always &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to be elements in these
               countries that potentially threaten the United States.

    OBAMA:     And we want to shrink those groups and those networks
               and we can do that. 
 
===================================

    OBAMA:     And we want to shrink those groups and those networks
               and we can do that.

 ** OBAMA:     But we&#39;re always also &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to maintain
               vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.

    OBAMA:     The truth, though, is that Al Qaeda is much weaker
               than it was when I came into office.

               very important one. 
 
===================================
Event 859: [lines 2639-2641]

    SCHIEFFER: I want to just begin this by asking both of you, and
               Mister President, you you go first this time.

 ** SCHIEFFER: What do you believe is the greatest future threat to
               the national security of this &lt;&lt;country&gt;&gt;?

    OBAMA:     Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist
               networks. 
 
===================================
Event 860: [lines 2643-2645]

    OBAMA:     But with respect to China, China is both an adversary,
               but also a potential partner in the international
               community if it&#39;s following the rules.

 ** OBAMA:     So my attitude coming into office was that we are
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to insist that China plays by the same rules
               as everybody else.

    OBAMA:     I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas;
               businesses and workers not getting a level playing
               field when it came to trade. 
 
===================================
Event 861: [lines 2651-2653]

    OBAMA:     I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for
               being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldn&#39;t
               be good for American workers and that it would be
               protectionist.

 ** OBAMA:     But I tell you, &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; workers don&#39;t feel that way.

    OBAMA:     They feel as if they had finally an administration who
               was going to take this issue seriously.

 ** OBAMA:     They feel as if they had finally an administration who
               was &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to take this issue seriously.

    OBAMA:     Over the long term, in order for us to compete with
               China, we&#39;ve also got to make sure, though, that we&#39;re
               taking taking care of business here at home. 
 
===================================
Event 863: [lines 2655-2657]

    OBAMA:     If we don&#39;t have the best education system in the
               world, if we don&#39;t continue to put money into research
               and technology that will allow us to create great
               businesses here in the United States, that&#39;s how we
               lose the competition.

 ** OBAMA:     And, unfortunately, Governor Romney&#39;s budget and his
               proposals would not allow us to make &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt;
               investments.

 ** ROMNEY:    Well, first of all, it&#39;s not &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; that makes
               business successful.

    ROMNEY:    Let me also note that the greatest threat that the

               a nuclear Iran.

Event 897: [lines 2814-2816]

    ROMNEY:    Good.

 ** OBAMA:     But more importantly it is true that in order for us
               to be competitive, we&#39;re &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have to make
               some smart choices right now.

    OBAMA:     Cutting our education budget, that&#39;s not a smart
               choice. 
 
===================================
Event 898: [lines 2819-2821]

    OBAMA:     That will not help us compete with China.

 ** OBAMA:     Bringing down our deficit by adding &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; seven
               trillion of tax cuts and &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; spending that
               our &lt;&lt;military&gt;&gt; is not asking for, before we even get
               to the debt that we currently have, that is not
               &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to make us more competitive.

    OBAMA:     Those are the kinds of choices that the American
               people face right now. 
 
===================================
Event 899: [lines 2825-2827]

    OBAMA:     That&#39;s why we have to move forward and not go back.

 ** ROMNEY:    I couldn&#39;t agree more about &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; forward, but I
               certainly don&#39;t want to go back to the policies of the
               last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    The policies of the last four years have seen incomes
               in America decline every year for middle income
               families, now down dollar four thousand three hundred
               during your term.

               three &lt;&lt;hundred&gt;&gt; during your term.

    ROMNEY:    Twenty three million Americans still struggling to
               find a good job. 
 
===================================
Event 901: [lines 2830-2832]

    ROMNEY:    Today, forty seven million people on food stamps.

 ** ROMNEY:    When you came to office, just over &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; ten
               trillion in debt, now &lt;&lt;dollar&gt;&gt; sixteen trillion in
               debt.

    ROMNEY:    It hasn&#39;t worked. 
 
===================================
Event 902: [lines 2833-2835]

    ROMNEY:    You said by now we&#39;d be at five.

 ** ROMNEY:    four &lt;&lt;percent&gt;&gt; unemployment.

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;re nine million jobs short of that. 
 
===================================
Event 903: [lines 2835-2837]

    ROMNEY:    We&#39;re nine million jobs short of that.

 ** ROMNEY:    I&#39;ve met some of &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; people.

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ve met them in Appleton, Wisconsin. 
 
===================================
Event 904: [lines 2839-2841]

    ROMNEY:    I&#39;ve been Ann was with someone just the other day that
               was just weeping about not being able to get work.

 ** ROMNEY:    It&#39;s just a tragedy in a nation so prosperous as ours,
               that the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; have been so hard.

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s why it&#39;s so critical, that we make America
               once again the most attractive place in the world to
               start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy. 
 
===================================

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s not going to happen by just hiring
               teachers. 
 
===================================
Event 906: [lines 2841-2843]

    ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s why it&#39;s so critical, that we make America
               once again the most attractive place in the world to
               start businesses, to build jobs, to grow the economy.

 ** ROMNEY:    And that&#39;s not &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to happen by just hiring
               teachers.

    ROMNEY:    Look, I love to I love teachers, and I&#39;m happy to have
               states and communities that want to hire teachers do
               that.

               states and communities that want to hire teachers do
               that.

 ** ROMNEY:    By the way, I don&#39;t like to have the federal
               &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; start pushing its weight deeper and
               deeper into our schools.

    ROMNEY:    Let the states and localities do that. 
 
===================================
Event 908: [lines 2845-2847]

    ROMNEY:    Let the states and localities do that.

 ** ROMNEY:    I was a &lt;&lt;governor&gt;&gt;.

    ROMNEY:    The federal government didn&#39;t hire our teachers. 
 
===================================
Event 909: [lines 2846-2848]

    ROMNEY:    I was a governor.

 ** ROMNEY:    The federal &lt;&lt;government&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t hire our teachers.

    ROMNEY:    But I love teachers. 
 
===================================
Event 910: [lines 2856-2858]

    OBAMA:     And now you&#39;ve got a choice.

 ** OBAMA:     Over the last four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt; we&#39;ve made real progress
               digging our way out of policies that gave us two
               prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic
               crisis since the Great Depression.

    OBAMA:     And Governor Romney wants to take us back to those
               policies, a foreign policy that&#39;s wrong and reckless,
               economic policies that won&#39;t create jobs, won&#39;t reduce
               our deficit, but will make sure that folks at the very
               top don&#39;t have to play by the same rules that you do.

    OBAMA:     And I&#39;ve got a different vision for America. 
 
===================================
Event 912: [lines 2863-2865]

    OBAMA:     And we&#39;re retaining our workers for the jobs of
               tomorrow.

 ** OBAMA:     I want to control our own &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; by developing oil
               and natural gas but also the &lt;&lt;energy&gt;&gt; sources of the
               future.

    OBAMA:     Yes, I want to reduce our deficit by cutting spending
               that we don&#39;t need but also by asking the wealthy to
               do a little bit more so that we can invest in things
               like research and technology that are the key to a
               twenty onest century economy.

    OBAMA:     As Commander in Chief, I will maintain the strongest
               military in the world, keep faith with our troops and
               go after those who would do us harm.

               and go after &lt;&lt;those&gt;&gt; who would do us harm.

    OBAMA:     but after a decade of war, I think we all recognize
               we&#39;ve got to do some nation building here at home,
               rebuilding our roads, our bridges and especially
               caring for our Veterans who sacrificed so much for our
               freedom.

               freedom.

 ** OBAMA:     And we&#39;ve been through tough times but we always
               bounce back because of our character, because we pull
               together and if I have the privilege of being your
               &lt;&lt;president&gt;&gt; for another four &lt;&lt;years&gt;&gt;, I promise
               you I will always listen to your voices.

    ROMNEY:    We have an opportunity to have real leadership.

 ** ROMNEY:    America&#39;s &lt;&lt;going&gt;&gt; to have that kind of leadership
               and continue to promote principles of peace to make a
               world a safer place and make people in this

               can take.

    ROMNEY:    One is a path represented by the president, which at

               twenty trillion in debt heading towards Greece.

               food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by
               getting them good jobs.

    ROMNEY:    America&#39;s going to come back, and for that to happen,
