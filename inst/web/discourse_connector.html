<div class='output'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; support is no change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 6-8]

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young,
            what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in
            place for them is to allow them either to choose the
            current Medicare program or a private plan.

    ROMNEY: Their choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 13-15]

    ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as
            the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as
            the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know my own view is &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather have a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; just assume not have the government telling me
            what kind of health care &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; get.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 15-17]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather be able to have an insurance company.

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like them, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can get rid of them and
            find a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 21-23]

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; put forward.

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 24-26]

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe in competition.

    OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 35-37]

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took.

 ** OBAMA:  One last point &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to make.

    OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare and Medicaid| 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 44-46]

    OBAMA:  Is that a is that a separate topic?

 ** LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to get to it.

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 45-47]

    LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, I want to get to it.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m&gt;&gt; sorry.

    LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly| 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: But all &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 70-72]

    ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work if you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: As a businessperson, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had to have &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; need to know
            the regulations.

    ROMNEY: I needed them there. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 71-73]

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; needed them there.

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; mean, you have to have regulations so that you can
            have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think has some unintended consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 86-88]

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government.

 ** ROMNEY: This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New York
            banks &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; ever seen.

    ROMNEY: This is an enormous boon for them. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY: Well, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; would repeal and replace it.

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 103-105]

    LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think this is a great example.

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, you know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 124-126]

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s why &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; have regulation.

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want
            to bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think we have another clear difference between the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 151-153]

    LEHRER: Why?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; sure do.

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: You know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; gone to that
            are saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 166-168]

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to put that money back in Medicare for our
            seniors.

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; just don&#39;t know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at
            the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for
            two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for
            jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was running for office,
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 192-194]

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, the last point &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; make before|

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had five seconds before you
            interrupted me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this
            model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor
            Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the
            state to set up what is essentially the identical model
            and as a consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs.

Event 1: [lines 2-4]

    LEHRER: But what do you support the voucher system, Governor?

 ** ROMNEY: What &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; support is no change for current retirees and
            near retirees to Medicare.

    ROMNEY: And the president supports taking dollar seven hundred
            sixteen billion out of that program. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 6-8]

    ROMNEY: So that&#39;s that&#39;s number one.

 ** ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming along that are young,
            what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in
            place for them is to allow them either to choose the
            current Medicare program or a private plan.

    ROMNEY: Their choice. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 13-15]

    ROMNEY: And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as
            the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as
            the private sector, people will be happy to get
            traditional Medicare or they&#39;ll be able to get a private
            plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know my own view is &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather have a private
            plan.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 14-16]

    ROMNEY: I know my own view is I&#39;d rather have a private plan.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; just assume not have the government telling me
            what kind of health care &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; get.

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 15-17]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d just assume not have the government telling me what
            kind of health care I get.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; rather be able to have an insurance company.

    ROMNEY: If I don&#39;t like them, I can get rid of them and find a
            different insurance company. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 16-18]

    ROMNEY: I&#39;d rather be able to have an insurance company.

 ** ROMNEY: If &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like them, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can get rid of them and
            find a different insurance company.

    ROMNEY: But people make their own choice. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 21-23]

    ROMNEY: We have to make sure this program is there for the long
            term.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s the plan that &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; put forward.

    ROMNEY: And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or
            or Senator Wyden, who&#39;s the co author of the bill with
            with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill
            Bill Clinton&#39;s chief of staff. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 24-26]

    ROMNEY: This is an idea that&#39;s been around a long time, which is
            saying, hey, let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t get competition into
            the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of
            different plans at lower cost, better quality.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe in competition.

    OBAMA:  Jim, if I if I can just respond very quickly, first of
            all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower
            administrative costs than private insurance does, which
            is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 25-27]

    ROMNEY: I believe in competition.

 ** OBAMA:  Jim, if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; if &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can just respond very quickly,
            first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has
            lower administrative costs than private insurance does,
            which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.

    OBAMA:  And private insurers have to make a profit. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 35-37]

    OBAMA:  And that&#39;s why they were supportive of the approach that
            we took.

 ** OBAMA:  One last point &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to make.

    OBAMA:  We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in
            Medicare and Medicaid| 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 44-46]

    OBAMA:  Is that a is that a separate topic?

 ** LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to get to it.

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 45-47]

    LEHRER: Yeah, we&#39;re going to yeah, I want to get to it.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&#39;m&gt;&gt; sorry.

    LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly| 
 
===================================
Event 13: [lines 46-48]

    OBAMA:  I&#39;m sorry.

 ** LEHRER: But all &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to do is go very quickly|

    ROMNEY: Let&#39;s get back to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 70-72]

    ROMNEY: You can&#39;t have a free market work if you don&#39;t have
            regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: As a businessperson, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had to have &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; need to know
            the regulations.

    ROMNEY: I needed them there. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 71-73]

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; needed them there.

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; mean, you have to have regulations so that you can
            have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 84-86]

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed.

 ** ROMNEY: And it includes within it a number of provisions that
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think has some unintended consequences that are
            harmful to the economy.

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 86-88]

    ROMNEY: One is it designates a number of banks as too big to
            fail, and they&#39;re effectively guaranteed by the federal
            government.

 ** ROMNEY: This is the biggest kiss that&#39;s been given to to New York
            banks &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; ever seen.

    ROMNEY: This is an enormous boon for them. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 93-95]

    LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd Frank?

 ** ROMNEY: Well, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; would repeal and replace it.

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 103-105]

    LEHRER: Let&#39;s let him respond let&#39;s let him respond to this
            specific on Dodd Frank and what the governor just said.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think this is a great example.

    OBAMA:  The reason we have been in such a enormous economic
            crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the
            board. 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, you know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 121-123]

    OBAMA:  Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

 ** OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; believe.

    ROMNEY: Sorry, but that&#39;s just not that&#39;s just not the facts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 124-126]

    ROMNEY: Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street.

 ** ROMNEY: That&#39;s why &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; have regulation.

    ROMNEY: But I wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to fail
            and give them a blank check. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 125-127]

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s why I&#39;d have regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: But &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; wouldn&#39;t designate five banks as too big to
            fail and give them a blank check.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd Frank. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 142-144]

    ROMNEY: Sometimes they didn&#39;t come out with a clear regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; will make sure we don&#39;t hurt the functioning of our
            of our marketplace and our business, because &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want
            to bring back housing and get good jobs.

    LEHRER: All right. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think we have another clear difference between the
            two of you.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 145-147]

    LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of you.

 ** LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; know there is
            a clear difference, and that has to do with the
            Affordable Care Act, Obamacare.

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 151-153]

    LEHRER: Why?

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; sure do.

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: You know, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 154-156]

    ROMNEY: You know, I was in New Hampshire.

 ** ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 155-157]

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

    ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses I&#39;ve gone to that are
            saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 156-158]

    ROMNEY: I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said,
            we&#39;re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can&#39;t afford
            it.

 ** ROMNEY: And the number of small businesses &lt;&lt;I&#39;ve&gt;&gt; gone to that
            are saying they&#39;re dropping insurance because they can&#39;t
            afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive.

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost. 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 164-166]

    ROMNEY: Expensive things hurt families.

 ** ROMNEY: So that&#39;s one reason &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t want it.

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 166-168]

    ROMNEY: Second reason, it cuts dollar seven hundred sixteen
            billion from Medicare to pay for it.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; want to put that money back in Medicare for our
            seniors.

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 168-170]

    ROMNEY: Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that&#39;s
            going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments
            they can have.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; don&#39;t like that idea.

    ROMNEY: Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
            across the country, said, what&#39;s been the effect of
            Obamacare on your hiring plans? 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 171-173]

    ROMNEY: And three quarters of them said it makes us less likely
            to hire people.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; just don&#39;t know how the president could have come
            into office, facing twenty three million people out of
            work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the at
            the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for
            two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for
            jobs for the American people.

    ROMNEY: It has killed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 176-178]

    LEHRER: Mister President, the argument against repeal?

 ** OBAMA:  Well, four years ago, when &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was running for office,
            &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; was traveling around and having those same
            conversations that Governor Romney talks about.

    OBAMA:  And it wasn&#39;t just that small businesses were seeing
            costs skyrocket and they couldn&#39;t get affordable coverage
            even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 192-194]

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

 ** OBAMA:  Now, the last point &lt;&lt;I&#39;d&gt;&gt; make before|

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; think &lt;&lt;I&gt;&gt; had five seconds before you
            interrupted me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this
            model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor
            Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the
            state to set up what is essentially the identical model
            and as a consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
</div>
<div class='input'>out2[[3]]
</div>
<div class='output'>===================================
Event 1: [lines 1-3]

    LEHRER: We&#39;ll talk about specifically about health care in a
            moment.

 ** LEHRER: But what do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; support the voucher system, Governor?

    ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near
            retirees to Medicare. 
 
===================================
Event 2: [lines 29-31]

    OBAMA:  That&#39;s what they do.

 ** OBAMA:  And so &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere. 
 
===================================
Event 3: [lines 30-32]

    OBAMA:  And so you&#39;ve got higher administrative costs, plus
            profit on top of that.

 ** OBAMA:  And if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

    OBAMA:  And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting
            seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. 
 
===================================
Event 4: [lines 31-33]

    OBAMA:  And if you are going to save any money through what
            Governor Romney&#39;s proposing, what has to happen is, is
            that the money has to come from somewhere.

            putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance
            companies.

    OBAMA:  And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or
            fallen apart, then they&#39;re stuck. 
 
===================================
Event 5: [lines 56-58]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: Can we can the two of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; agree that the voters have
            a choice a clear choice between the two|

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 6: [lines 58-60]

    ROMNEY: Absolutely.

 ** LEHRER: of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; on Medicare?

    ROMNEY: Absolutely. 
 
===================================
Event 7: [lines 65-67]

    LEHRER: And in your case, Mister President, is there should there
            be more?

 ** LEHRER: Beginning with &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: This is not a new two minute segment to start. 
 
===================================
Event 8: [lines 69-71]

    ROMNEY: Regulation is essential.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; can&#39;t have a free market work if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; don&#39;t
            have regulation.

    ROMNEY: As a businessperson, I had to have I need to know the
            regulations. 
 
===================================
Event 9: [lines 72-74]

    ROMNEY: I needed them there.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in
            their garage and making loans.

    ROMNEY: I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have
            an economy work. 
 
===================================
Event 10: [lines 73-75]

    ROMNEY: You couldn&#39;t have people opening up banks in their in

 ** ROMNEY: I mean, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; have to have regulations so that &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            can have an economy work.

    ROMNEY: Every free economy has good regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 11: [lines 76-78]

    ROMNEY: At the same time, regulation can become excessive.

 ** LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; think?

    ROMNEY: In some places, yes. 
 
===================================
Event 12: [lines 81-83]

    ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date.

 ** ROMNEY: And what&#39;s happened with some of the legislation that&#39;s
            been passed during the president&#39;s term, &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; seen
            regulation become excessive, and it&#39;s hurt it&#39;s hurt the

 ** ROMNEY: Let me give &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; an example.

    ROMNEY: Dodd Frank was passed. 
 
===================================
Event 14: [lines 92-94]

    ROMNEY: In Dodd Frank|

 ** LEHRER: Do &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; want to repeal Dodd Frank?

    ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. 
 
===================================
Event 15: [lines 95-97]

    ROMNEY: We&#39;re not going to get rid of all regulation.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; have to have regulation.

    ROMNEY: And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the
            sense in the world. 
 
===================================
Event 16: [lines 97-99]

    ROMNEY: And there are some parts of Dodd Frank that make all the
            sense in the world.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; need transparency, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; need to have leverage
            limits for|

    LEHRER: Well, here&#39;s a specific| 
 
===================================
Event 17: [lines 106-108]

    OBAMA:  Now, it wasn&#39;t just on Wall Street.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford. 
 
===================================
Event 18: [lines 107-109]

    OBAMA:  You had loan officers were that were giving loans and
            mortgages that really shouldn&#39;t have been given, because
            the folks didn&#39;t qualify.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had people who were borrowing money to buy a
            house that they couldn&#39;t afford.

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t. 
 
===================================
Event 19: [lines 108-110]

    OBAMA:  You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house
            that they couldn&#39;t afford.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; had credit agencies that were stamping these as
            Aone great investments when they weren&#39;t.

    OBAMA:  But you also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. 
 
===================================
Event 20: [lines 109-111]

    OBAMA:  You had credit agencies that were stamping these as Aone
            great investments when they weren&#39;t.

 ** OBAMA:  But &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; also had banks making money hand over fist,
            churning out products that the bankers themselves didn&#39;t
            even understand, in order to make big profits, but
            knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.

    OBAMA:  So what did we do? 
 
===================================
Event 21: [lines 112-114]

    OBAMA:  We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street
            since the one thousand nine hundred thirtys.

 ** OBAMA:  We said &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got banks, &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got to raise
            your capital requirements.

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk. 
 
===================================
Event 22: [lines 113-115]

    OBAMA:  We said you&#39;ve got banks, you&#39;ve got to raise your
            capital requirements.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that
            is putting Main Street at risk.

    OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that you&#39;ve got to have a living
            will so so we can know how you&#39;re going to wind things
            down if you make a bad bet so we don&#39;t have other
            taxpayer bailouts. 
 
===================================
Event 23: [lines 114-116]

    OBAMA:  You can&#39;t engage in some of this risky behavior that is
            putting Main Street at risk.

 ** OBAMA:  We&#39;ve going to make sure that &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got to have a
            living will so so we can know how &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; going to
            wind things down if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; make a bad bet so we don&#39;t
            have other taxpayer bailouts.

    OBAMA:  In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all
            the help that we provided those banks was paid back every
            single dime, with interest. 
 
===================================
Event 24: [lines 117-119]

    OBAMA:  Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd
            Frank.

 ** OBAMA:  And, &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; know, I appreciate and it appears we&#39;ve got
            some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have
            some regulation.

    OBAMA:  But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to
            repeal Dodd Frank, roll it back. 
 
===================================
Event 25: [lines 120-122]

    OBAMA:  And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that
            the big problem we had is that there was too much
            oversight and regulation of Wall Street?

 ** OBAMA:  Because if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; do, then Governor Romney is your
            candidate.

    OBAMA:  But that&#39;s not what I believe. 
 
===================================
Event 26: [lines 131-133]

    ROMNEY: Let me mention another regulation in Dodd Frank.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; say we were giving mortgages to people who
            weren&#39;t qualified.

    ROMNEY: That&#39;s exactly right. 
 
===================================
Event 27: [lines 134-136]

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity
            we had.

 ** ROMNEY: And so Dodd Frank correctly says we need to have
            qualified mortgages, and if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; give a mortgage
            that&#39;s not qualified, there are big penalties, except
            they didn&#39;t ever go on and define what a qualified
            mortgage was.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s been two years. 
 
===================================
Event 28: [lines 139-141]

    ROMNEY: Try and get a mortgage these days.

 ** ROMNEY: It&#39;s hurt the housing market because Dodd Frank didn&#39;t
            anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations
            &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; have to have.

    ROMNEY: It&#39;s not that Dodd Frank always was wrong with too much
            regulation. 
 
===================================
Event 29: [lines 144-146]

    LEHRER: All right.

 ** LEHRER: I think we have another clear difference between the two
            of &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;.

    LEHRER: Now, let&#39;s move to health care where I know there is a
            clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable
            Care Act, Obamacare. 
 
===================================
Event 30: [lines 147-149]

    LEHRER: And it&#39;s a two minute new new segment, and that means two
            minutes each.

 ** LEHRER: And &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; go first, Governor Romney.

    LEHRER: You want it repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 31: [lines 148-150]

    LEHRER: And you go first, Governor Romney.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; want it repealed.

    LEHRER: You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. 
 
===================================
Event 32: [lines 149-151]

    LEHRER: You want it repealed.

 ** LEHRER: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; want the Affordable Care Act repealed.

    LEHRER: Why? 
 
===================================
Event 33: [lines 153-155]

    ROMNEY: Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience.

 ** ROMNEY: &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; know, I was in New Hampshire.

    ROMNEY: A woman came to me and she said, look, I can&#39;t afford
            insurance for myself or my son. 
 
===================================
Event 34: [lines 158-160]

    ROMNEY: And and we&#39;ve got to deal with cost.

 ** ROMNEY: And, unfortunately, when when when &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; look at
            Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it
            will cost dollar two thousand five hundred a year more
            than traditional insurance.

    ROMNEY: So it&#39;s adding to cost. 
 
===================================
Event 35: [lines 183-185]

    OBAMA:  So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs,
            because this is part of making sure that middle class
            families are secure in this country.

 ** OBAMA:  And let me tell &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; exactly what Obamacare did.

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover. 
 
===================================
Event 36: [lines 184-186]

    OBAMA:  And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did.

 ** OBAMA:  Number one, if &lt;&lt;you&#39;ve&gt;&gt; got health insurance, it
            doesn&#39;t mean a government takeover.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance. 
 
===================================
Event 37: [lines 185-187]

    OBAMA:  Number one, if you&#39;ve got health insurance, it doesn&#39;t
            mean a government takeover.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; keep your own insurance.

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor. 
 
===================================
Event 38: [lines 186-188]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own insurance.

 ** OBAMA:  &lt;&lt;You&gt;&gt; keep your own doctor.

    OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk you
            around. 
 
===================================
Event 39: [lines 187-189]

    OBAMA:  You keep your own doctor.

 ** OBAMA:  But it does say insurance companies can&#39;t jerk &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            around.

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. 
 
===================================
Event 40: [lines 189-191]

    OBAMA:  They can&#39;t impose arbitrary lifetime limits.

 ** OBAMA:  They have to let &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; twenty six years
            old.

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care. 
 
===================================
Event 41: [lines 190-192]

    OBAMA:  They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance
            your insurance plan until you&#39;re twenty six years old.

 ** OBAMA:  And it also says that &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; going to have to get
            rebates if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

    OBAMA:  Number two, if you don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to
            benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if you&#39;re out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market. 
 
===================================
Event 42: [lines 191-193]

    OBAMA:  And it also says that you&#39;re going to have to get rebates
            if insurance companies are spending more on
            administrative costs and profits than they are on actual
            care.

 ** OBAMA:  Number two, if &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; don&#39;t have health insurance, we&#39;re
            essentially setting up a group plan that allows &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            to benefit from group rates that are typically eighteen
            percent lower than if &lt;&lt;you&#39;re&gt;&gt; out there trying to get
            insurance on the individual market.

    OBAMA:  Now, the last point I&#39;d make before| 
 
===================================
Event 43: [lines 194-196]

    LEHRER: Two minutes two minutes is up, sir.

 ** OBAMA:  No, I think I had five seconds before &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt; interrupted
            me, was the irony is that we&#39;ve seen this model work
            really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did
            a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set
            up what is essentially the identical model and as a
            consequence people are covered there.

    OBAMA:  It hasn&#39;t destroyed jobs. 
 
===================================
Event 44: [lines 199-200]

    LEHRER: All right, Governor.

 ** LEHRER: Governor, tell tell the president directly why &lt;&lt;you&gt;&gt;
            think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?
